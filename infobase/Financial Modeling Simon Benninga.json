Preface The three previous editions of Financial Modeling have received a gratifyingly positive response from readers. The combination of a “cookbook,” mixing explanation and implementation using Excel, has fulfilled a need in both the academic and the practitioner markets from readers who realize that the imple-mentation of the finance basics typically studied in an introductory finance course requires another, more heavily computational and implementational approach. Excel, the most widely used computational tool in finance, is a natural vehicle for deepening our understanding of the materials. In this fourth edition of Financial Modeling , I have added a section (Chap- ters 24–30) on Monte Carlo methods. The intention is to add a focus on the simulation of financial models. I have become convinced that a statistical understanding of modeling (“What is the mean and sigma of the portfolio return?”) understates the impact of the uncertainty. Only by simulating the models and the return processes can we get a good feel for the dimensions of the uncertainty. With the added section on Monte Carlo, Financial Modeling now consists of seven sections. Each of the first five sections of the book relates to a specific area of finance. These sections are independent of each other, though the reader should realize that they all assume some familiarity with the finance area— Financial Modeling is not an introductory text. Section I (Chapters 1–7) deals with corporate finance topics; Section II (Chapters 8–14) with portfolio models; Section III (Chapters 15–19) with option models; and Section IV (Chapters 20–23) with bond-related topics. Section V , as discussed above, introduces the reader to Monte Carlo methods in finance. The last two sections of Financial Modeling are technical in nature. Section VI (Chapters 31–35) relates to various Excel topics which are used throughout the book. Chapters in Section VI can be read and accessed as necessary. Section VII (Chapters 36–39) deals with Excel ’ s programming language, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). VBA is used throughout Financial Modeling to create functions and routines which make life easier, but it is never intrusive—in principle the reader can understand the materials in all of the other chapters of Financial Modeling without needing the VBA chapters. New Materials and Updates This edition of Financial Modeling contains much new and updated material. We have already mentioned the new section on Monte Carlo methods. Also new are two chapters on valuation (Chapters 2 and 4) and a chapter on term structure modeling (Chapter 22). Much of the material has been tweaked xxii Preface and improved. For example, the discussion of Excel financial functions now includes a discussion of XIRR and XNPV , including a fix for the bugs in these functions. Getformula The Excel files with this edition include a function called Getformula that enables the user to track cell contents. Getformula is discussed in Chapter 0 and also on a file on the disk that is included with Financial Modeling . To allow Getformula to work, go to File|Options|Trust Center : In the Trust Center settings, I recommend the following setting: xxiii Preface If you have done this, then when opening an Excel notebook for the first time, you will be confronted by the following warning: For notebooks that come with this book, you can safely click Enable Content , which enables the formulas on the notebook. Excel Versions In the examples throughout the book I have used Excel 2013. To the best of my knowledge, all of the spreadsheets work in Excel versions 2003, 2007, 2010, and 2011 (for Mac), although some minor and obvious adaptations by the reader may be called for. Files for the Fourth Edition Purchasers of Financial Modeling get access to all the Excel files for the chapters and exercises. Using Financial Modeling in a University Course Financial Modeling has become the book of choice in many advanced finance classes that stress the combination of modeling/Excel skills and a deeper understanding of the underlying financial models. The Financial Modeling – based courses are often a third- or fourth-year undergraduate or second-year MBA course. The courses are very different and include much instructor-specific input, but they seem to have a few general features in common: • A typical course starts with two or three classes which stress the Excel skills needed for financial modeling. Often these courses are held in a computer lab. Though almost all business school students know Excel, they often do not know the finesses of data tables (Chapter 31), some of the basic financial functions (Chapters 1 and 33), and array functions (Chapter 34). • Most one-semester courses then cover at most one of the Financial Modeling sections. If we assume that in a typical university course, covering one chapter per week is an upper limit (and many chapters will require two weeks), then a typical course might concentrate on either corporate finance (Chapters 1–7), xxiv Preface portfolio models (Chapters 8–14), or options (Chapters 15–19). At a stretch, the instructor could perhaps throw in the shorter bond section (Chapters 20–23). • I suggest that after the initial classes in a computer lab, the instructor move to a regular classroom. This enables the classroom emphasis to be on discus-sions of theory and implementation, with student homework concentrating on actual spreadsheets. A major problem with a computer-based course is how to structure the final examination. Two solutions seem to work well. One alternative is to have students (whether alone or in teams) submit a final project; examples might be a corporate valuation if the course is based on Section I of the book, an event study for Section II, an option-based project for Section III, or the com-putation of a bond-expected return if the emphasis is on Section IV . A second alternative is to have students submit, by e-mail, a spreadsheet-based examina-tion with severe time limits. One instructor using this book sends his class the final exam (a compendium of spreadsheet problems) at 9 in the morning and requires an e-mail with a spreadsheet answer by noon.

From the Preface to the Third Edition The two previous editions of Financial Modeling have received a gratifyingly positive response from readers. The combination of a “cookbook,” mixing explanation and implementation using Excel has fulfilled a need in both the academic and the practitioner markets from readers who realize that the imple-mentation of the finance basics typically studied in an introductory finance course requires another, more heavily computational and implementational, approach. Excel, the most widely used computational tool in finance, is a natural vehicle for deepening our understanding of the materials.

Finally, I want to thank my very patient wife, Terry, who has maintained her own and my equilibrium through two books and a business school deanship in the past five years. From the Preface to the Second Edition The purpose of this book remains to provide a “cookbook” for implementing common financial models in Excel. This edition has been expanded by six additional chapters, covering financial calculations, cost of capital, value at risk (VaR), real options, early exercise boundaries, and term-structure model-ing. There is also an additional technical chapter containing a potpourri of Excel hints. I am indebted to a number of people (in addition to those mentioned in the previous preface) for help and suggestions: Andrew A. Adamovich, Alejandro Sanchez Arevalo, Yoni Aziz, Thierry Berger-Helmchen, Roman Weissman Bermann, Michael Giacomo Bertolino, John Bollinger, Enrico Camerini, Manuel Carrera, Roy Carson, John Carson, Lydia Cassorla, Philippe Charlier, Michael J.

I also want to thank my editors, who again have been a great help: Nancy Lombardi, Peter Reinhart, Victoria Richardson, and Terry Vaughn. From the Preface to the First Edition Like its predecessor Numerical Techniques in Finance, the aim of this book is to present some important financial models and to show how they can be solved numerically and/or simulated using Excel. In this sense this is a finance “cookbook;” like any cookbook, it gives recipes with a list of ingredients and instructions for making and baking. As any cook knows, a recipe is just a starting point; having followed the recipe a number of times, you can think of your own variations and make the results suit your tastes and needs. Financial Modeling covers standard financial models in the areas of corpo- rate finance, financial statement simulation, portfolio problems, options, port-folio insurance, duration, and immunization. The aim in each case has been to explain clearly and concisely the implementation of the models using Excel. Very little theory is offered except where necessary to understand the numeri-cal implementations. While Excel is often not the tool to use for high-level, industrial-strength calculations (portfolios are an example), it is an excellent tool for understand-ing the computational intricacies involved in financial modeling. It is often the case that the fullest understanding of the models comes by calculating them, and Excel is one of the most accessible and powerful tools available for this purpose. Along the way a lot of students, colleagues, and friends (these are nonex- clusive categories) have helped me with advice and comments. In particular I would like to thank Olivier Blechner, Miryam Brand, Elizabeth Caulk, John Caulk, Benjamin Czaczkes, John Ferrari, John P. Flagler, Dan Fylstra, Kuni-hiko Higashi, Julia Hynes, Don Keim, Anthony Kim, Ken Kunimoto, Rick Labs, Adrian Lawson, Philippe Nore, Isidro Sanchez Alvarez, Nir Sharabi, Edwin Strayer, Robert Taggart, Mark Thaler, Terry Vaughn, and Xiaoge Zhou. Finally, my thanks go to a wonderful set of editors: Nancy Lombardi, Peter Reinhart, Victoria Richardson, and Terry Vaughn. 0 Before All Else 0.1 Data Tables Financial Modeling makes extensive use of data tables. I advise readers of the book to fi rst make sure that they understand data tables (read Chapter 31, sec-tions 1–5). Data tables are absolutely critical in the sensitivity analysis that is part of most fi nancial models. They are a little bit complicated, but an invalu- able addition to the modeling arsenal of the fi nancial modeler. In the remainder of this short chapter, I discuss Getformula . 0.2 What Is Getformula? The Excel notebooks in Financial Modeling , fourth edition, contain a function called Getformula that aids in annotating your spreadsheets. In the example below, cell C5 shows the formula contained in cell B5; the formula in question computes the annual repayment of a loan of 165,000 for 7 years at 8%. Cell C5 contains the function = Getformula(B5) . 2 345AB C Principal 165,000 Interest 8% s r a e y - - < 7 m r e T Annual payment 31,691.95 <-- =PMT(B3,B4,-B2) In this short chapter, we describe how to add this formula to your Excel note- book. Mac users: This works only in Excel 2011. 0.3 How to Put Getformula into Your Excel Notebook 1. Open the Excel workbook in which you want the formula to work. 2. Open the VBA editor: • On Windows computers: Press [Alt] + F11. • On Mac (Excel 2011): Choose Tools|Macro|Visual Basic Editor 2 Chapter 0 n e e r c s c a M n e e r c s s w o d n i W 3. This will open the VBA editor. 3 Before All Else 4. Select Insert|Module at the top of the screen. Å Windows screen Å Mac screen 5. Now insert the following text into the Module window (where it says General ). Just copy/paste the text below. 4 Chapter 0 ‘8/5/2006 Thanks to Maja Sliwinski and ‘Beni Czaczkes Function getformula(r As Range) As String Application.Volatile If r.HasArray Then getformula = “ < –– “ & _ “ {“ & r.FormulaArray & “}” Else getformula = “ < –– “ & _ “ “ & r.FormulaArray End If End Function In Windows, close the VBA window (no need to save). On the Mac, just continue to work on the spreadsheet. The formula is now part of the spread- sheet and will be saved along with it. 0.4 Saving the Excel Workbook: Windows To save the notebook with the Getformula macro in VBA, you will have to save it as a Macro-enabled workbook . 5 Before All Else Macro-enabled workbooks have the extension .xlsm, whereas regular Excel workbooks have the extension .xlsx. Your users will never know the difference. We have changed our Excel settings ( File|Options|Save ) to make the Macro- enabled workbook our default: 0.5 Saving the Excel Workbook: Mac The Mac screen for saving as a Macro-enabled workbook looks like this: 6 Chapter 0 0.6 Do You Have to Put Getformula into Each Excel Workbook? The short answer is “yes.” You could create an add-in to Excel (see Chapter 39) that contains Getformula , but this will make it more diffi cult for you to share your workbooks. We prefer to put Getformula in each new spreadsheet we create. 0.7 A Shortcut to Use Getformula Once you have put Getformula into your Excel workbook, you will have to use it! Ninety percent of our uses of this function point to the cell to the left of the formula itself: We ’ ve put a short macro into our Personal workbook that automates this procedure. The remainder of this section describes how to automate the Getformula procedure. Automating the Procedure We want to automate this procedure of putting Getformula into a cell: • Turn it into a macro. • Attach a key sequence (in our case, [Ctrl] + t) to the macro. • Make the macro and key sequence available in your Excel spreadsheets. 7 Before All Else We will save the macro to our Personal.xlsb fi le. This fi le activates each time you start Excel. It ’ s yours only—other readers of your spreadsheets won ’ t see it. Below we describe the steps, for both Windows and the Mac. 0.8 Recording Getformula: The Windows Case Here are the steps to recording the macro in Windows: • Activate the Developer tab on the menu bar. • Use Record Macro to save a macro as a personal notebook. Activate the Developer Tab Go to File|Options|Customize Ribbon and activate the Developer tab as shown below: Use Record Macro The Developer tab allows you to record a macro and save it as part of the Personal.xlsb notebook. We will illustrate with the copy as picture feature. 8 Chapter 0 1. Open a blank Excel notebook and click on the Developer tab and then on Record Macro : Excel will ask for details of the recording. Here ’ s what I wrote. We will save this as a Personal Macro Workbook and then use the shortcut [Ctrl] + t: 2. Now go to your spreadsheet and use Getformula , pointing to the cell to the left of where you want Getformula to appear. In the spreadsheet below, we have typed = Getformula(A3) into cell B4: 9 Before All Else 3. Go back to the Developer tab and stop the recording: 4. Close down Excel. Excel will ask you if you want to save the Personal workbook. The answer is, of course, positive: This creates the following fi le (“simon benninga” is of course my user name on my computer—you will substitute your user name). C:\\Users\\simon benninga\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Excel\\XLSTART\\ PERSONAL.XLSB Using the Macro From now on, whenever you open a fi le on your computer , you can use [Ctrl] + t to copy a region as a picture. Cool! 10 Chapter 0 0.9 Recording Getformula: The Mac Case To record a macro in Excel, use Tools|Macro|Record New Macro : To stop the recording: As in the Windows case, you will be prompted to name the macro and assign it a control key sequence. When you save the spreadsheet, you will be asked if you want to save the Personal Workbook. Done! I CORPORATE FINANCE AND V ALUATION The seven chapters that open Financial Modeling cover basic problems and techniques in corporate finance. Chapter 1 is an introduction to basic financial calculations using Excel. Chapter 2 is a short overview of various valuation methods as applied to corporations. The cost of capital, discussed in Chapter 3, is the rate at which corporate cash flows are discounted to arrive at enterprise value. Calculating this rate is not trivial and involves a combination of theoreti-cal models and numerical computation, both discussed in the chapter. Chapters 4 and 5 discuss two primary valuation methods. Chapter 4 shows how to derive the free cash flows required for valuation from the consolidated statement of cash flows. Chapter 5 shows how to build pro forma models, which simulate the corporate income statement and balance sheets. Pro forma models are at the heart of many corporate finance applications, including busi-ness plans, credit analyses, and valuations. The models require a mixture of finance, accounting, and Excel. Chapter 6 develops a pro forma model to value Caterpillar Corporation. The example we develop is typical of an exercise which accompanies many merger and acquisition valuations. Section I closes with a discussion of the financial analysis of leasing in Chapter 7. 1 Basic Financial Calculations 1.1 Overview This chapter aims to give you some fi nance basics and their Excel implementa- tion. If you have had a good introductory course in fi nance, this chapter is likely to be at best a refresher. 1 This chapter covers: • Net present value (NPV) • Internal rate of return (IRR) • Payment schedules and loan tables • Future value • Pension and accumulation problems • Continuously compounded interest • Time-dated cash fl ows (Excel functions XNPV and XIRR ) Almost all fi nancial problems are centered on fi nding the value today of a series of cash receipts over time . The cash receipts (or cash fl ows, as we will call them) may be certain or uncertain. The present value of a cash fl ow CF t anticipated to be received at time t is CF rt t1+() . The numerator of this expression is usually understood to be the expected time t cash fl ow , and the discount rate r in the denominator is adjusted for the riskiness of this expected cash fl ow—the higher the risk, the higher the discount rate. The basic concept in present value calculations is the concept of opportunity cost . Opportunity cost is the return which would be required of an investment to make it a viable alternative to other, similar investments. In the fi nancial literature there are many synonyms for opportunity cost, among them: discount rate, cost of capital, and interest rate. When applied to risky cash fl ows, we will sometimes call the opportunity cost the risk-adjusted discount rate (RADR) or the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). It goes without saying that this discount rate should be risk-adjusted, and much of the standard fi nance literature discusses how to do this. As illustrated below, when we calculate the net present value, we use the investment ’ s opportunity cost as a discount rate. When we calculate the internal rate of return, we compare the calculated return to the investment ’ s opportunity cost to judge its value. 1. In my book Principles of Finance with Excel (Oxford University Press, 2nd edition, 2008) I have discussed many basic Excel/fi nance topics at greater length. 14 Chapter 1 1.2 Present Value and Net Present Value Both of these concepts are related to the value today of a set of future antici- pated cash fl ows. As an example, suppose we are valuing an investment which promises $100 per year at the end of this and the next 4 years. We suppose that these cash fl ows are risk free: There is no doubt that this series of 5 pay-ments of $100 each will actually be paid. If a bank pays an annual interest rate of 10% on a 5-year deposit, then this 10% is the investment ’ s opportunity cost, the alternative benchmark return to which we want to compare the invest-ment. We can calculate the value of the investment by discounting its cash fl ows using this opportunity cost as a discount rate: 1 2 3 4 567 8 9 101112 13 14AB C D % 0 1 e t a r t n u o c s i D Year Cash flowPresent value 5 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 5 B = - - < 1 9 0 9 . 0 9 0 0 1 1 6 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 6 B = - - < 6 4 4 6 . 2 8 0 0 1 2 7 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 7 B = - - < 5 1 3 1 . 5 7 0 0 1 3 8 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 8 B = - - < 3 1 0 3 . 8 6 0 0 1 4 9 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 9 B = - - < 1 2 9 0 . 2 6 0 0 1 5 Net present value Summing cells C5:C9 379.08 <-- =SUM(C5:C9) Using Excel's NPV function 379.08 <-- =NPV(B2,B5:B9) Using Excel's PV function 379.08 <-- =PV(B2,5,-100)COMPUTING THE PRESENT VALUE The present value , 379.08, is the value today of the investment. In a competi- tive market, the present value should correspond to the market price of the cash fl ows. The spreadsheet illustrates three ways of obtaining this value: • Summing the individual present values in cells C5:C9. To simplify the copying, note the use of “ ∧ ” to represent the power and the use of both the relative and absolute references; for example: = B5/(1 + $B$2) ∧ A5 in cell C5. • Using the Excel NPV function. As we show on the next page, Excel ’ s NPV function is unfortunately misnamed—it actually computes the present value and not the net present value. 15 Basic Financial Calculations • Using the Excel PV function. This function computes the present value of a series of constant payments. PV(B2,5,-100) is the present value of 5 pay- ments of 100 each at the discount rate in cell B2. The PV function returns a negative value for positive cash fl ows; to prevent this unfortunate occurrence, we have made the cash fl ows negative. 2 The Difference Between Excel ’ s PV and NPV Functions The above spreadsheet may leave the misimpression that PV and NPV perform exactly the same computation. But this is not true—whereas NPV can handle any series of cash fl ows, PV can handle only constant cash fl ows: 1 2 3 4 567 8 9 10 11 1213AB C D % 0 1 e t a r t n u o c s i D YearCash flowPresent valuePresent value of each cash flow 5 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 5 B = - - < 1 9 0 9 . 0 9 0 0 1 1 6 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 6 B = - - < 3 9 8 2 . 5 6 1 0 0 2 2 7 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 7 B = - - < 4 4 9 3 . 5 2 2 0 0 3 3 8 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 8 B = - - < 4 5 0 2 . 3 7 2 0 0 4 4 9 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 9 B = - - < 7 0 6 4 . 0 1 3 0 0 5 5 Net present value Summing cells C5:C9 1065.26 <-- =SUM(C5:C9) Using Excel's NPV function 1065.26 <-- =NPV(B2,B5:B9)COMPUTING THE PRESENT VALUE In this example the cash flows are not equal Either discount each cash flow separately or use Excel's NPV function Excel's PV doesn't work for this case Excel ’ s NPV Function Is Misnamed! In standard fi nance terminology, the present value of a series of cash fl ows is the value today of the future cash fl ows: Present valueCF rt t tN = +()=∑11 2. This strange property—returning negative values for positive cash fl ows—is shared by a number of otherwise impeccable Excel functions such as PMT and PV . The somewhat convoluted logic which led Microsoft to write these functions this way is not worth explaining. 16 Chapter 1 The net present value is the present value minus the cost of acquiring the asset (the cash fl ow at time zero): Net present valueCF rCFt t tN CF= +()= =↑ <∑100 0 0In many cases me ,aaning that it represents the price paid for the asset./verticalbraceright+CF t 1 11+()= ↑ ′∑rt tN This is the present value given by Excel s NPV , ffunction./dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext Excel ’ s language about discounted cash fl ows differs somewhat from the standard fi nance nomenclature. To calculate the fi nance net present value of a series of cash fl ows using Excel, we have to calculate the present value of the future cash fl ows (using the Excel NPV function), taking into account the time-zero cash fl ow (this is often the cost of the asset in question). The Net Present Value, NPV Suppose that the above investment is sold for $400. Clearly it would not be worth its purchase price, since—given the alternative return (discount rate) of 10%—the investment is worth only $379.08. The net present value (NPV) is the applicable concept here. Denoting by r the discount rate applicable to the investment, the NPV is calculated as follows: NPV CFCF rt t tN =+ +()=∑ 0 11 where CF t is the investment ’ s cash fl ow at time t and CF 0 is today ’ s cash fl ow. Suppose, for example, that the series of 5 cash fl ows of $100 is sold for $250. Then, as shown below, the NPV = 129.08. 1 2 3 4 5 6789 1011 12 1314AB C D % 0 1 e t a r t n u o c s i D Year Cash flowPresent value 0 -250 -250.00 <-- =B5/(1+$B$2)^A5 6 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 6 B = - - < 1 9 . 0 9 0 0 1 1 7 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 7 B = - - < 4 6 . 2 8 0 0 1 2 8 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 8 B = - - < 3 1 . 5 7 0 0 1 3 9 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 9 B = - - < 0 3 . 8 6 0 0 1 4 0 1 A ^ ) 2 $ B $ + 1 ( / 0 1 B = - - < 9 0 . 2 6 0 0 1 5 Net present value Summing cells C5:C10 129.08 <-- =SUM(C5:C10) Using Excel's NPV function 129.08 <-- =B5+NPV(B2,B6:B10)COMPUTING THE NET PRESENT VALUE 17 Basic Financial Calculations The NPV represents the wealth increment of the purchaser of the cash fl ows. If you buy the series of 5 cash fl ows of 100 for 250, then you have gained 129.08 in wealth today. In a competitive market the NPV of a series of cash fl ows ought to be zero: Since the present value should correspond to the market price of the cash fl ows, the NPV should be zero. In other words, the market price of our 5 cash fl ows of 100 ought—in a competitive market, assuming that 10% is the correct risk-adjusted discount rate—be 379.08. The Present Value of an Annuity—Some Useful Formulas 3 An annuity is a security which pays a constant sum in each period in the future. Annuities may have a fi nite or infi nite series of payments. If the annuity is fi nite, and the appropriate discount rate is r , then the value today of the annuity is its present value: PV of finite annuityC rC rC r Cr rn n=++ +()+…+ +() =− +()⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎜⎜⎞1 11 11 12 ⎠ ⎠⎟⎟⎟ If the annuity promises an infi nite series of constant future payments, then this formula reduces to: PV of infinite annuityC rC rC r=++ +()+…=1 12 Both of these formulas can be computed with Excel. Below we compute the value of a fi nite annuity in three ways: using the formula (cell B6), using Excel ’ s PV function (cell B7), and using Excel ’ s NPV function: 3. All the formulas in this subsection depend on some well-known but oft-forgotten high school algebra. 18 Chapter 1 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516C B A 0 0 0 , 1 C , t n e m y a p c i d o i r e P Number of future periods paid, n 5 % 2 1 r , e t a r t n u o c s i D Present value of annuity 4 B / ) 3 B ^ ) 4 B + 1 ( / 1 - 1 ( * 2 B = - - < 8 7 . 4 0 6 , 3 a l u m r o f g n i s U Using Excel's PV function 3,604.78 <-- =PV(B4,B3,-B2) PeriodAnnuit y payment 2 B = - - < 0 0 . 0 0 0 , 1 1 0 0 . 0 0 0 , 1 2 0 0 . 0 0 0 , 1 3 0 0 . 0 0 0 , 1 4 0 0 . 0 0 0 , 1 5 Present value using Excel's NPV function 3,604.78 <-- =NPV(B4,B10:B14)COMPUTING THE VALUE OF A FINITE ANNUITY 1 2 3 4C B A 0 0 0 , 1 C , t n e m y a p c i d o i r e P % 2 1 r , e t a r t n u o c s i D 3 B / 2 B = - - < 3 3 . 3 3 3 , 8 y t i u n n a f o e u l a v t n e s e r PCOMPUTING THE VALUE OF AN INFINITE ANNUITY Computing the value of an infi nite annuity is even simpler: The Value of a Growing Annuity A growing annuity pays out a sum C , which grows at a periodic growth rate g .

Determining the IRR by Trial and Error There is no simple formula to compute the IRR.

To understand this fully, it helps to make a loan table , which shows the division of the invest- ment ’ s cash fl ows between investment income and the return of the investment principal: 1 2345 6 789 10 11 12 13 14 15 1617 18 19 20 21 22 23 2425 26AB C D E F Year Cash flow 0 -800 0 0 2 1 0 5 2 2 0 0 3 3 0 5 3 4 0 0 4 5 Internal rate of return 22.16% <-- =IRR(B3:B8) USING THE IRR IN A LOAN TABLE YearInvestment at beginning of yearCash flow at end of year IncomeReturn of principal 1 800.00 200.00 177.28 22.72 <-- =C15-D15 2 777.28 250.00 172.25 77.75 3 699.53 300.00 155.02 144.98 4 554.55 350.00 122.89 227.11 5 327.44 400.00 72.56 327.44 6 0.00INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN Division of cash flow between investment income and return of principal=-B3 =B15-E15=$B$10*B15 The remaining investment principal in the year after the last cash flow is zero, indicating that all the principal has been repaid. 24 Chapter 1 The loan table divides each of the cash fl ows of the asset into an income component and a return-of-principal component. The income component at the end of each year is IRR times the principal balance at the beginning of that year. Notice that the principal at the beginning of the last year (327.44 in the example) exactly equals the return of principal at the end of that year. We can use the loan table to fi nd the internal rate of return. Consider an investment costing 1,000 today that pays off the cash fl ows indicated below at the end of years 1, 2, … 5. At a rate of 15% (cell B2), the principal at the beginning of year 6 is negative, indicating that too little has been paid out in income. Thus the IRR must be larger than 15%: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 10111213AB C D E F IRR? 15.00% YearPrincipal at beginning of yearCash flow at end of year Income Principal 1 1,000.00 300 150.00 150.00 <-- =C6-D6 2 850.00 200 127.50 72.50 3 777.50 150 116.63 33.38 4 744.13 600 111.62 488.38 5 255.74 900 38.36 861.64 6 -605.89USING A LOAN TABLE TO FIND THE IRR Division of cash flow between investment income and return of principal =$B$2*B6 =B6-E6 If the interest rate in cell B3 is indeed the IRR, then cell B11 should be 0. We can use Excel ’ s Goal Seek (found under Data|What-if analysis ) to calculate the IRR: 25 Basic Financial Calculations As shown below, the IRR is 24.44%: 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 1011 12 13AB C D E F IRR? 24.44% YearPrincipal at beginning of yearCash flow at end of year Income Principal 1 1,000.00 300 244.36 55.64 <-- =C6-D6 2 944.36 200 230.76 -30.76 3 975.13 150 238.28 -88.28 4 1,063.41 600 259.86 340.14 5 723.26 900 176.74 723.26 60 .00USING A LOAN TABLE TO FIND THE IRR Division of cash flow between investment income and return of principal =$B$2*B6 =B6-E6 26 Chapter 1 The loan table is an effective illustration that the IRR is the interest rate that pays off an investment over its term. Of course, we could have simplifi ed life by just using the IRR function: 15 16 171819 20 21222324AB C D Year Cash flow 0 -1,000 13 00 22 00 31 50 46 00 59 00 IRR 24.44% <-- =IRR(B17:B22)Direct calculation of IRR Excel ’ s Rate Function Excel ’ s Rate function computes the IRR of a series of constant future pay- ments. In the example below, we pay $1,000 today for an annual payment of $100 for the next 30 years. Rate shows that the IRR is 9.307%: 1 2 345AB C Initial investment 1,000 Periodic cash flow 100 Number of payments 30IRR 9.307% <-- =RATE(B4,B3,-B2)USING EXCEL'S RATE FUNCTION TO COMPUTE THE IRR Note: Rate works much like PMT and PV discussed elsewhere in this chapter; it requires a sign change between the initial investment and the peri- odic cash fl ow (note that we have used –B2 in cell B5). It also has switches to allow for payments which start today and payments which start one period from now (not shown in the above example). 27 Basic Financial Calculations 1.4 Multiple Internal Rates of Return Sometimes a series of cash fl ows has more than one IRR. In the next example we can tell that the cash fl ows in cells B6:B11 have two IRRs, since the NPV graph crosses the x-axis twice: 1 2 3 4 5 6789 101112131415161718 19 20 2122232425262728293031AB C D E F G H I Discount rate 6%NPV -3.99 <-- =NPV(B2,B7:B11)+B6 DATA TABLE Discoun t rate NPV Year Cash flow -3.99 Table header, <-- =B3 0 -145 0% -20.00 1 100 3% -10.51 2 100 6% -3.99 3 100 9% 0.24 4 100 12% 2.69 5 -275 15% 3.77 18% 3.8021% 3.0224% 1.6227% -0.2430% -2.4433% -4.9036% -7.53 39% -10.27 Identifying the two IRRsFirst IRR 8.78% <-- =IRR(B6:B11,0) Second IRR 26.65% <-- =IRR(B6:B11,0.3)MULTIPLE INTERNAL RATES OF RETURN Note : For a discussion of how to create data tables in Excel, see Chapter 31. -25.00-20.00-15.00-10.00-5.000.005.00 0% 10% 20% 30% 40%Net present valueDiscount rateTwo IRRs Excel ’ s IRR function allows us to add an extra argument which will help us fi nd both IRRs. Instead of writing = IRR(B6:B11) , we write = IRR(B6:B11,guess) . The argument guess is a starting point for the algorithm which Excel uses to fi nd the IRR; by adjusting the guess , we can identify both the IRRs. Cells B30 and B31 give an illustration. 28 Chapter 1 There are two things to note about this procedure: • The argument guess merely has to be close to the IRR; it is not unique. For example, by setting the guesses equal to 0.1 and 0.5, we will still get the same IRRs: 29 30 31AB C D Identifying the two IRRs First IRR 8.78% <-- =IRR(B6:B11,0.1) Second IRR 26.65% <-- =IRR(B6:B11,0.5) • In order to identify the number and the approximate value of the IRRs, it helps greatly to graph (as we did above) the NPV of the investment as a func-tion of various discount rates. The internal rates of return are then the points where the graph crosses the x-axis, and the approximate location of these points should be used as the guesses in the IRR function. 4 From a purely technical point of view, a set of cash fl ows can have multiple IRRs only if it has at least two changes of sign. Many typical cash fl ows have only one change of sign. Consider, for example, the cash fl ows from purchas-ing a bond having a 10% coupon, a face value of $1,000, and 8 more years to maturity. If the current market price of the bond is $800, then the stream of cash fl ows changes signs only once (from negative in year 0 to positive in years 1–8). Thus there is only one IRR: 1 2 34 5 6789 101112 13 14151617AB C D EFGH I JK Year Cash flow Data table: Effect of 0 -800 discount rate on NPV B , 4 E ( V P N = - - < 0 0 . 0 0 0 , 1 0 0 1 1 4:B11)+B3, table header 0 0 . 0 0 0 , 1 % 0 0 0 1 2 4 0 . 6 8 7 % 2 0 0 1 3 6 9 . 3 0 6 % 4 0 0 1 4 9 3 . 8 4 4 % 6 0 0 1 5 3 9 . 4 1 3 % 8 0 0 1 6 0 0 . 0 0 2 % 0 1 0 0 1 7 5 6 . 0 0 1 % 2 1 0 0 1 , 1 8 14% 14.45 IRR 14.36% <-- =IRR(B3:B11) 16% -60.62 18% -126.21 20% -183.72BOND CASH FLOWS: NPV CROSSES X-AXIS ONLY ONCE, SO THERE IS ONLY ONE IRR -400-200020040060080010001200 0% 5% 10% 15% 20%NPV Discount rateNPV of Bond Cash Flows 4. If you don ’ t put in a guess (as we did in the previous section), Excel defaults to a guess of 0.1. Thus, in the current example, IRR(B34:B39) will return 8.78%. 29 Basic Financial Calculations 1.5 Flat Payment Schedules Another common problem is to compute a “fl at” repayment for a loan. For example: You take a loan for $10,000 at an interest rate of 7% per year. The bank wants you to make a series of payments which will pay off the loan and the interest over 10 years. We can use Excel ’ s PMT function to determine how much each annual payment should be: Notice that we have put “PV”—Excel ’ s nomenclature for the initial loan principal—with a minus sign. As discussed above, if we do not do this Excel returns a negative payment (a minor irritant). You can confi rm that the answer of 2,097.96 is correct by creating a loan table: 30 Chapter 1 The zero in cell C15 indicates that the loan is fully repaid over its term of 6 years. You can easily confi rm that the present value of the payments over the 6 years is the initial principal of 10,000. 1.6 Future Values and Applications We start with a triviality. Suppose you deposit 1,000 in an account today, leaving it there for 10 years. Suppose the account draws annual interest of 10%. How much will you have at the end of 10 years? The answer, as shown in the following spreadsheet, is 2,593.74: 1 2 3 4 567 8 9 10 1112131415AB C D E F G Loan principal 10,000Interest rate 7% Loan term 6 <-- Number of years over which loan is repaid Annual payment 2,097.96 <-- =PMT(B3,B4,-B2) Split payment into: YearPrincipal at beginning of yearPayment at end of year InterestReturn of principal 1 10,000.00 2,097.96 700.00 1,397.96 2 8,602.04 2,097.96 602.14 1,495.823 7,106.23 2,097.96 497.44 1,600.524 5,505.70 2,097.96 385.40 1,712.565 3,793.15 2,097.96 265.52 1,832.446 1,960.71 2,097.96 137.25 1,960.7170 .00FLAT PAYMENT SCHEDULES =$B$3*C9 =D9-E9 =C9-F9 31 Basic Financial Calculations 1 2 3 4 56789 10 11 121314151617AB C D E Interest 10% YearAccount balance, beginning of yearInterest earned during yearTotal in account, end year 1 1,000.00 100.00 1,100.00 <-- =C5+B5 2 1,100.00 110.00 1,210.00 <-- =C6+B6 3 1,210.00 121.00 1,331.00 4 1,331.00 133.10 1,464.10 5 1,464.10 146.41 1,610.51 6 1,610.51 161.05 1,771.56 7 1,771.56 177.16 1,948.72 8 1,948.72 194.87 2,143.59 9 2,143.59 214.36 2,357.95 10 2,357.95 235.79 2,593.74 11 2,593.74 A simpler way 2,593.74 <-- =B5*(1+B2)^10SIMPLE FUTURE VALUE =D5=$B$2*B5 As cell C17 shows, you don ’ t need all these complicated calculations: The future value of 1,000 in 10 years at 10% per year is given by: FV=+ () = 1 000 1 10 2 593 7410,% , .* Now consider the following, slightly more complicated, problem: Again, you intend to open a savings account. Your initial deposit of 1,000 today will be followed by a similar deposit at the beginning of years 1, 2, … , 9. If the account earns 10% per year, how much will you have in the account at the start of year 10? 32 Chapter 1 This problem is easily modeled in Excel: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 1516 17 18AB C D E F % 0 1 t s e r e t n I Annual deposit 1,000 <-- Made today and at beginning of each of next 9 years Number of deposits 10 YearAccount balance, beginning of yearDeposit at beginning of yearInterest earned during yearTotal in account, end year 1 0.00 1,000 100.00 1,100.00 <-- =D7+C7+B7 2 1,100.00 1,000 210.00 2,310.00 <-- =D8+C8+B8 3 2,310.00 1,000 331.00 3,641.00 4 3,641.00 1,000 464.10 5,105.10 5 5,105.10 1,000 610.51 6,715.61 6 6,715.61 1,000 771.56 8,487.17 7 8,487.17 1,000 948.72 10,435.89 8 10,435.89 1,000 1,143.59 12,579.48 9 12,579.48 1,000 1,357.95 14,937.42 10 14,937.42 1,000 1,593.74 17,531.17 Future value 17,531.17 <-- =FV(B2,B4,-B3,,1)FUTURE VALUE WITH ANNUAL DEPOSITS =$B$2*(B7+C7) =E7 Thus the answer is that we will have 17,531.17 in the account at the end of year 10. This same answer can be represented as a formula that sums the future values of each deposit: Total at beginning of year 10 1 000 1 10 1 000 1 1010 9=+ () ++ () ++,% ,%** … 1 1 000 1 10 1 000 1 101 110,* % ,%+() =+ () =∑ *t t An Excel function : Note from cell B18 that Excel has a function FV which gives this sum. The dialog box brought up by FV is the following: 33 Basic Financial Calculations We note three things about this function: • For positive deposits FV returns a negative number. This is an irritating property of this function, which it shares with PV and PMT . To avoid negative numbers, we have put the Pmt in as − 1,000. • The line Pv in the dialog box refers to a situation wherein the account has some initial value other than 0 when the series of deposits is made. In the above example, this has been left blank, which indicates that the initial account value is zero. • As noted in the picture, “Type” (either 1 or 0) refers to whether the deposit is made at the beginning or the end of each period (in our example the former is the case). 1.7 A Pension Problem—Complicating the Future Value Problem A typical exercise is the following: You are currently 55 years old and intend to retire at age 60. To make your retirement easier, you intend to start a retire-ment account: • At the beginning of each of years 1, 2, 3, 4 (that is, starting today and at the beginning of each of the next four years), you intend to make a deposit into the retirement account. You think that the account will earn 8% per year. 34 Chapter 1 • After retirement at age 60, you anticipate living 8 more years. 5 At the begin- ning of each of these years you want to withdraw $30,000 from your retirement account. Your account balances will continue to earn 8%. How much should you deposit annually in the account? The following spreadsheet fragment below shows how easily you can go wrong in this kind of problem—in this case, you ’ ve calculated that in order to provide $30,000 per year for 8 years, you need to contribute $240,000/5 = $48,000 in each of the fi rst 5 years. As the spreadsheet shows, you ’ ll end up with a lot of money at the end of 8 years! (The reason—you ’ ve ignored the powerful effects of compound interest. If you set the interest rate in the spreadsheet equal to 0%, you ’ ll see that you ’ re right.) 1 2 345 6 7 89 1011 12 131415 16 171819 20 21AB C D E F % 8 t s e r e t n I Annual deposit 48,000.00 Annual retirement withdrawal 30,000.00 =$B$2*(C7+B7) YearAccount balance, beginning ofyearDeposit at beginning of yearInterest earned during yearTotal in account, end year 7 B + 7 C + 7 D = - - < 0 0 . 0 4 8 , 1 5 0 0 . 0 4 8 , 3 0 0 . 0 0 0 , 8 4 0 0 . 0 1 2 51,840.00 48,000.00 7,987.20 107,827.20 3 107,827.20 48,000.00 12,466.18 168,293.38 4 168,293.38 48,000.00 17,303.47 233,596.85 5 233,596.85 48,000.00 22,527.75 304,124.59 6 304,124.59 -30,000.00 21,929.97 296,054.56 7 296,054.56 -30,000.00 21,284.36 287,338.93 8 287,338.93 -30,000.00 20,587.11 277,926.04 9 277,926.04 -30,000.00 19,834.08 267,760.12 10 267,760.12 -30,000.00 19,020.81 256,780.93 11 256,780.93 -30,000.00 18,142.47 244,923.41 12 244,923.41 -30,000.00 17,193.87 232,117.28 13 232,117.28 -30,000.00 16,169.38 218,286.66A RETIREMENT PROBLEM Note : This problem has 5 deposits and 8 annual withdrawals, all made at the beginning of the year. The beginning of year 13 is the last year of the retirement plan; if the annual deposit is correctly computed, the balance at the beginning of year 13 after the withdrawal should be zero. 5. Of course you ’ re going to live much longer! And I wish you good health! The dimensions of this problem have been chosen to make it fi t nicely on a page. 35 Basic Financial Calculations There are several ways to solve this problem. The fi rst involves Excel ’ s Solver . This can be found on the Data menu. 6 6. If the Solver does not appear on the Tools menu, then you have to load it. Go to File|Options|Add- ins and click Solver Add-In on the list of programs. Note that you could also use the Goal Seek tool to solve this problem. For simple problems such as this one, there is not much difference between the Solver and Goal Seek ; the one (not inconsiderable) advantage of the Solver is that it remembers its previous arguments, so that if you bring it up again on the same spreadsheet, you can see what you did in the previous iteration. In later chapters we will illustrate problems that cannot be solved by Goal Seek and in which the use of the Solver is a necessity. 36 Chapter 1 Clicking on Solver opens a dialog box.

We can now use Excel ’ s PV and PMT functions to solve the problem: 38 Chapter 1 1.8 Continuous Compounding Suppose you deposit $1,000 in a bank account which pays 5% per year. This means that at the end of the year you will have $1,000*(1.05) = $1,050. Now suppose that the bank interprets “5% per year” to mean that it pays you 2.5% interest twice a year. Thus after 6 months you ’ ll have $1,025, and after 1 year you will have $, *.$, . 1 000 100 5 21 050 6252 +⎛ ⎝⎞⎠= . By this logic, if you get paid interest n times per year, your accretion at the end of the year will be $, *.1 000 100 5+⎛⎝⎞⎠ n n . As n increases this amount gets larger, converging (rather quickly, as you will soon see) to e 0.05 , which in Excel is written as the function Exp . When n is infi nite, we refer to this as continuous compounding . (By typing Exp(1) in a spreadsheet cell, you can see that e = 2.7182818285. … ) As you can see in the next display, $1,000 continuously compounded for 1 year at 5% grows to $1,000* e 0.05 = $1,051.271 at the end of the year. Continu- ously compounded for t years, it will grow to $1,000* e 0.05* t , where t need not be a whole number (for example, when t = 4.25 then the accumulation factor e 0.05*4.25 measures the growth of the initial investment at 5% annually, continu- ously compounded for 4 years and 3 months). 1 2 34 5 67C B A % 8 t s e r e t n I Annual retirement withdrawal 30,000.00 Years of withdrawal 8 5 t i s o p e d f o s r a e Y Present value of withdrawals 117,331.98 <-- =-PV(B2,B4,B3)/(1+B2)^B5Annual deposit 29,386.55 <-- =PMT(B2,B5,-B6)A RETIREMENT PROBLEM 39 Basic Financial Calculations 1 2 3456789 1011121314151617181920212223 24 252627282930313233C B A 0 0 0 , 1 t i s o p e d l a i t i n I % 5 e t a r t s e r e t n I Number of compounding periods per year 2 Interest per compounding period 2.500% <-- =B3/B4 4 B ^ ) 5 B + 1 ( * 2 B = - - < 5 2 6 . 0 5 0 , 1 r a e y e n o n i n o i t e r c c A Continuous compounding with Exp 1,051.271 <-- =B2*EXP(B3) Compounding periods per yearEnd-year accretion 5 2 A ^ ) 5 2 A / 3 $ B $ + 1 ( * 2 $ B $ = - - < 0 0 0 . 0 5 0 , 1 1 6 2 A ^ ) 6 2 A / 3 $ B $ + 1 ( * 2 $ B $ = - - < 5 2 6 . 0 5 0 , 1 2 0 4 1 . 1 5 0 , 1 0 1 6 0 2 . 1 5 0 , 1 0 2 5 4 2 . 1 5 0 , 1 0 5 8 5 2 . 1 5 0 , 1 0 0 1 2 6 2 . 1 5 0 , 1 0 5 1 7 6 2 . 1 5 0 , 1 0 0 3 9 6 2 . 1 5 0 , 1 0 0 8MULTIPLE COMPOUNDING PERIODS Effect of Multiple Compounding Periods 1,049.801,050.001,050.201,050.401,050.601,050.801,051.001,051.201,051.40 1 10 100 1000Number of compounding intervals End-year accretion The conclusion: More compounding periods increase the future value, though there is a clear asymptotic value; as we will see below, for accretion over t years, this value is e rt . Back to Finance—Continuous Discounting If the accretion factor for continuous compounding at interest r over t years is e rt , then the discount factor for the same period is e − rt . Thus a cash fl ow C t occurring in year t and discounted at continuously compounded rate r will be worth C t e – rt today. This is illustrated below: 40 Chapter 1 Calculating the Continuously Compounded Return from Price Data Suppose at time 0 you had $1,000 in the bank and suppose that 1 year later you had $1,200. What was your percentage return? Although the answer may appear obvious, it actually depends on the compounding method. If the bank paid interest only once a year, then the return would be 20%: 1 200 1 00012 0, ,% −= However, if the bank paid interest twice a year, you would need to solve the following equation to calculate the return: 1 000 121 20021 200 1 0001 9 54452 12 ,* ,, ,.%/ +⎛ ⎝⎞⎠=⇒ =⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟−=rr The annual percentage return when interest is paid twice a year is therefore 2*9.5445% = 19.089%.

All of this may seem somewhat esoteric. However, continuous compounding/ discounting is often used in fi nancial calculations. In this book, it is used to calculate portfolio returns (Chapters 8–13) and in practically all of the options calculations (Chapters 15–19). There ’ s another reason to use continuous compounding—its ease of calcula- tion. Suppose, for example, that your $1,000 grew to $1,500 in 1 year and 9 months. What ’ s the annualized rate of return? The easiest—and most consistent—way to do this is to calculate the continuously compounded annual return. Since 1 year and 9 months equals 1.75 years, this return is: 1 000 1 75 1 5001 17 51 500 1 00023 1694 , *exp * . ,.ln, ,.% rr[] =⇒ =⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥= 42 Chapter 1 1.9 Discounting Using Dated Cash Flows Most of the computations in this chapter consider cash fl ows which occur at fi xed periodic intervals. Typically we look at cash fl ows which occur on dates 0, 1, … , n , where the period indicates an annual, semi-annual, or other fi xed interval. Two Excel functions, XIRR and XNPV , allow us to do computations on cash fl ows which occur on specifi c dates that need not be at even intervals. 7 In the following example we compute the IRR of an investment of $1,000 made on 1 January 2014 with payments on specifi c dates: 7.

Fixing Bugs in XNPV and XIRR Both XNPV and XIRR have bugs, which Microsoft has not fi xed in several versions of Excel. The fi le with this chapter includes functions that fi x these bugs, called NXNPV and NXIRR . 8 • XNPV doesn ’ t work with zero or negative interest rates. • XIRR does not identify multiple internal rates of return. The XNPV relates to the failure of this function to correctly deal with zero or negative discount rates. 8.

You are offered an asset costing $600 that has cash fl ows of $100 at the end of each of the next 10 years. a. If the appropriate discount rate for the asset is 8%, should you purchase it? b. What is the IRR of the asset? 2. You just took a $10,000, 5-year loan. Payments at the end of each year are fl at (equal in every year) at an interest rate of 15%. Calculate the appropriate loan table, showing the breakdown in each year between principal and interest. 3. You are offered an investment with the following conditions: • The cost of the investment is 1,000. • The investment pays out a sum X at the end of the fi rst year; this payout grows at the rate of 10% per year for 11 years. If your discount rate is 15%, calculate the smallest X which would entice you to purchase the asset. For example, as you can see in the following display, X = $100 is too small—the NPV is negative: 46 Chapter 1 1 23 4 567 8 9 101112 13 141516 17AB C Discount rate 15% Initial payment 129.2852NPV -226.52 <-- =B6+NPV(B1,B7:B17) Yea r Cash flow 0 -1,000.001 100.00 <-- 100 2 110.00 <-- =B7*1.1 3 121.00 <-- =B8*1.1 4 133.10 5 146.41 6 161.05 7 177.16 8 194.87 9 214.36 10 235.79 11 259.37 4.

In this exercise we solve iteratively for the internal rate of return. Consider an investment which costs 800 and has cash fl ows of 300, 200, 150, 122, 133 in years 1–5. Setting up the loan table below shows that 10% is greater than the IRR (since the return of principal at the end of year 5 is less than the principal at the beginning of the year): 47 Basic Financial Calculations Setting the IRR? cell equal to 3% shows that 3% is less than the IRR, since the return of principal at the end of year 5 is greater than the principal at the beginning of year 5.

Using the Goal Seek function of Excel, fi nd this rate (below we illustrate how the screen should look). 9. In general, of course, the IRR is the rate of return that makes the principal in the year following the last payment equal to zero. 48 Chapter 1 (Of course you should check your calculations by using the Excel IRR function.) 7. Calculate the fl at annual payment required to pay off a 13%, 5-year loan of $100,000. 8. You have just taken a car loan of $15,000. The loan is for 48 months at an annual interest rate of 15% (which the bank translates to a monthly rate of 15%/12 = 1.25%). The 48 payments (to be made at the end of each of the next 48 months) are all equal. a. Calculate the monthly payment on the loan. b. In a loan table calculate, for each month: the principal remaining on the loan at the beginning of the month and the split of that month ’ s payment between interest and repayment of principal. c. Show that the principal at the beginning of each month is the present value of the remaining loan payments at the loan interest rate (use either NPV or the PV functions). 9. You are considering buying a car from a local auto dealer. The dealer offers you one of two payment options: • You can pay $30,000 cash. • The “deferred payment plan”: You can pay the dealer $5,000 cash today and a payment of $1,050 at the end of each of the next 30 months. As an alternative to the dealer fi nancing, you have approached a local bank, which is willing to give you a car loan of $25,000 at the rate of 1.25% per month. 49 Basic Financial Calculations 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011DE F G H Month Cash paymentPayment under deferred payment planDifference 0 30,000 5,000 25,000 <-- =E3-F3 1 0 1,050 -1,050 <-- =E4-F4 2 0 1,050 -1,050 3 0 1,050 -1,050 4 0 1,050 -1,050 5 0 1,050 -1,050 6 0 1,050 -1,050 7 0 1,050 -1,050 8 0 1,050 -1,050 Now calculate the IRR of the difference column; this is the monthly effective interest rate on the deferred payment plan. 10.

Redo the previous calculation, this time assuming that you make 5 deposits at the begin- ning of this year and the following 4 years. How much will you accumulate by the end of year 5? 12.

You have just turned 35, and you intend to start saving for your retirement. Once you retire in 30 years (when you turn 65), you would like to have an income of $100,000 per year for the next 20 years. Calculate how much you would have to save between now and age 65 in order to fi nance your retirement income. Make the following assumptions: • All savings draw compound interest of 10% per year. • You make the fi rst payment today and the last payment on the day you turn 64 (30 payments). • You make the fi rst withdrawal when you turn 65 and the last withdrawal when you turn 84 (20 payments). 14. You currently have $25,000 in the bank, in a savings account that draws 5% interest. Your business needs $25,000, and you are considering two options: (a) Use the money in your savings account. (b) Borrow the money from the bank at 6%, leaving the money in the savings account. 51 Basic Financial Calculations 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 1415 16F E D C B A % 5 d e n r a e t s e r e t n I % 6 d i a p t s e r e t n I 0 0 0 , 5 2 t i s o p e d l a i t i n I YearPrincipal at beginning of yearPayment at end of yearInterest paidRepayment of principal 1 25,000.00 13,635.92 1,500.00 12,135.92 <-- =C8-D8 2 12,864.08 13,635.92 771.84 12,864.08 Total interest paid 2,271.84 YearIn savings account at beginning of yearEnd-year interest earnedIn account at end of year 1 25,000.00 1,250.00 26,250.002 26,250.00 1,312.50 27,562.50 Interest earned 2,562.50THE 6% LOAN Savings Account=PMT($B$3,2,-$B$4)EXERCISE 14, financial analyst's calculations 15.

This chapter aims to provide a short overview of this complicated topic. In succeeding chapters we turn to the components of valuation: The computation of the cost of capital (Chapter 3), the direct valuation of corporate free cash fl ows from the fi rm ’ s consolidated statement of cash fl ows (Chapter 4), and the projection of fi rm pro forma fi nancial state- ments (Chapters 5 and 6). What Is Corporate Valuation About? When we discuss the valuation of a company, we may be referring to any of the following: • Enterprise value: Valuing the company ’ s productive activities. • Equity: Valuing the shares of a company, whether for the purpose of buying or selling a single share or valuing all of the equity for purposes of a corporate acquisition. • Debt: Valuing the company ’ s debt. When debt is risky, its value depends on the value of the company that has issued the debt. • Other: We may want to value other securities related to the company—for example, the fi rm ’ s warrants or options, employee stock options, etc. In Chapters 2–6 of Financial Modeling , we discuss the fi rst two of these topics, leaving the valuation of debt and other securities for later chapters. 1 2.2 Four Methods to Compute Enterprise Value (EV) The key concept in corporate valuation is enterprise value . The enterprise value (EV) of the fi rm is the value of the fi rm ’ s core business activities and forms the basis of most corporate valuation models. We distinguish between four approaches to computing the enterprise value: 1. Valuation of risky bonds is discussed in Chapter 23. The valuation of derivative securities is discussed in Chapters 15–19, 29, and 30. 54 Chapter 2 • The accounting approach to EV moves items on the balance sheet so that all operating items are on the left-hand side of the balance sheet and all fi nan- cial items are on the right-hand side. Although most academics sneer at this approach, it is often a useful starting point for thinking about the enterprise value. • The effi cient markets approach to EV revalues—to the extent possible— items on the accounting EV balance sheet at market values. An obvious revalu- ation is to replace the fi rm ’ s book value of equity with the market value of the equity. To the extent that we know the market value of other fi rm liabilities— debt, pension obligations, etc.—this market value will also replace the book values. • The discounted cash fl ow (DCF) approach values the EV as the present value of the fi rm ’ s future anticipated free cash fl ows (FCFs) discounted at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The FCFs can best be thought of as the cash fl ows produced by the fi rm ’ s productive assets—its working capital, fi xed assets, goodwill, etc. • In this book we use two implementations of the DCF approach. These approaches differ in their derivation of the fi rm ’ s free cash fl ows. Ⴜ In Chapter 4 we base our projections of future anticipated FCFs on an analysis of the fi rm ’ s consolidated statement of cash fl ows. Ⴜ In Chapters 5 and 6 we base our projections of future anticipated FCFs on a pro forma model for the fi rm ’ s fi nancial statements. 2.3 Using Accounting Book Values to Value a Company: The Firm ’ s Accounting Enterprise Value While we would rarely use accounting numbers to value a company, the balance sheet of a company is a useful starting framework for the valuation process. In this section we show how accounting statements can help us defi ne the concept of enterprise value (EV). As a starting point, consider the balance sheet for XYZ Corp.: 55 Corporate Valuation Overview We rewrite this balance sheet: • We separate the operational versus fi nancial items in short-term assets and short-term liabilities. • We move the operational current assets to the left side of the balance sheet. • We move all the debt (short-term debt, current portion of long-term debt, and long-term) into one debt item. 1 2 34 5 6789 10 11 12131415 16 171819E D C B A E t i u q e d n a s e i t i l i b a i L s t e s s A y s e i t i l i b a i l m r e t - t r o h S s t e s s a m r e t - t r o h S 0 0 5 , 1 e l b a y a p s t n u o c c A 0 0 0 , 1 h s a C 0 0 2 e l b a y a p s e x a T 0 0 5 , 1 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a M 0 0 0 , 1 t b e d m r e t - g n o l f o n o i t r o p t n e r r u C 0 0 5 , 1 s e i r o t n e v n I 0 0 5 t b e d m r e t - t r o h S 0 0 0 , 3 e l b a v i e c e r s t n u o c c A 0 0 5 , 1 t b e d m r e t - g n o L s t e s s a d e x i F 0 0 8 s e i t i l i b a i l n o i s n e P 0 5 1 d n a L Plant, property and equipment at cost 2,500 0 0 2 k c o t s d e r r e f e r P 0 0 7 - n o i t a i c e r p e d d e t a l u m u c c a s u n i M 0 0 1 t s e r e t n i y t i r o n i M s t e s s a d e x i f t e N Equity 0 0 0 , 1 r a p t a k c o t S 0 0 0 , 1 l l i w d o o G Accumulated retained earnings 3,500Stock repurchases -350 t i u q e d n a s e i t i l i b a i l l a t o T 0 5 9 , 9 s t e s s a l a t o T y 9,950XYZ CORP BALANCE SHEET 56 Chapter 2 In the next step we subtract liquid assets (cash and marketable securities) from fi nancial debts, to get the fi rm ’ s net fi nancial debt.

Notice that we netted out liquid assets (cash and marketable securities) from the fi nancial debts of the company. The assumption is that these assets are not needed for the core business activities of Caterpillar. The book value of Caterpillar ’ s enterprise value is $59,476,000: 2. We revisit CAT in Chapter 3, where we compute its weighted average cost of capital, and in Chapter 4, where we build a pro forma for the company. 58 Chapter 2 2.4 The Effi cient Markets Approach to Corporate Valuation The Caterpillar example above assumes that the book value is a correct valu- ation of the company. But a simple calculation shows how problematic this is: At the end of 2011 Caterpillar had 624.72 million shares outstanding, and the market price per share was $90.60. This suggests that the Caterpillar ’ s enter-prise value is $102.720 billion—a far cry from the book value of the enterprise value of $59.476 billion. 1 2 3456 7 89F E D C B A Net working capital 16,158,000 <-- =19533000+14544000+994000-16946000-1967000Net financial debt 31,535,000 <-- =9648000+24944000 - 3057000 Long-term investments 13,211,000 Other liabilities 14,539,000 Property, plant, and equipment 14,395,000 0 0 0 , 6 4 t s e r e t n i y t i r o n i M 0 0 0 , 0 8 0 , 7 l l i w d o o G Intangible assets 4,368,000 0 0 0 , 6 5 3 , 3 1 y t i u q E 0 0 0 , 7 0 1 , 2 s t e s s a r e h t O Deferred long-term asset charges 2,157,000 Enterprise value 59,476,000 <-- =SUM(B2:B8) Enterprise value 59,476,000 <-- =SUM(E2:E7)CATERPILLAR CORP., 2011 ENTERPRISE VALUE BALANCE SHEET Book values 1 23 4 56789 10 11 12131415 16C B A 2 7 . 2 2 7 , 4 2 6 g n i d n a t s t u o s e r a h s f o r e b m u N <-- thousand shares 0 6 . 0 9 e r a h s r e p e c i r P <-- 30dec2011 8 7 8 , 9 9 5 , 6 5 ) \" p a C t e k r a M \" ( e u l a v y t i u q E <-- =B2*B3, thousand $ 0 0 0 , 7 5 0 , 3 s t n e l a v i u q e h s a c d n a h s a C Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt 9,648,000 0 0 0 , 4 4 9 , 4 2 t b e d m r e t - g n o L 0 0 0 , 5 3 5 , 1 3 t b e d t e N <-- =SUM(B7:B8)-B6 0 0 0 , 9 3 5 , 4 1 s e i t i l i b a i l r e h t O 0 0 0 , 6 4 t s e r e t n i y t i r o n i M 0 k c o t s d e r r e f e r P Enterprise value: Equity + Net debt + Minorit y Interest + Preferred102,719,878 <-- =SUM(B4,B9,B11,B13)CATERPILLAR VALUATION OF EQUITY AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES: EFFICIENT MARKETS APPROACH Most figures in thousand $ The effi cient markets approach to the valuation of Caterpillar ’ s equity and fi nancial liabilities assumes that the market value of a company ’ s shares or 59 Corporate Valuation Overview debt is simply the market value at the time of valuation. This approach is better than the accounting approach of the previous section and much simpler than the DCF valuations illustrated in succeeding sections and in Chapters 5 and 6. Moreover, it has the power of logic and much academic research behind it. If markets work—in the sense that there are many participants trading the corporate securities, that there is a lot of information about the company in question, and that the valuator has no special information—why not accept the market price as the true value of the company? 3 Applying the effi cient markets approach to the Caterpillar Enterprise Value Balance sheet gives 102,719,878 for the right-hand side of the enterprise value balance sheet. This means, of course, that we have to revalue the left-hand side of the balance sheet. One approach to bringing this enterprise value balance sheet into balance is to assume that the net working capital ’ s book value is a reasonable approximation to its market value. We can then recompute the market value of the fi rm ’ s long-term assets to bring the balance sheet into balance. 1 2 345678 9 1011 121314151617 18 1920F E D C B A Net working capital 16,158,000 <-- =19533000+14544000+994000-16946000- 1967000Net financial debt 31,535,000 <-- =9648000+24944000 - 3057000 0 0 0 , 9 3 5 , 4 1 s e i t i l i b a i l r e h t O s t n e m t s e v n i m r e t - g n o L Property, plant, and equipment 0 0 0 , 6 4 t s e r e t n i y t i r o n i M l l i w d o o G Intangible assets 8 7 8 , 9 9 5 , 6 5 y t i u q E s t e s s a r e h t O <-- Market cap Deferred long-term asset charges Enterprise value 102,719,878 <-- =SUM(B2:B8) Enterprise value 102,719,878 <-- =SUM(E2:E7)CATERPILLAR CORP., 2011 ENTERPRISE VALUE BALANCE SHEET Right-hand side revalued at market values Left-hand side brought into balance with right-hand side by adjusting long-term assets 86,561,878 <-- =E10-B2 3. We have to be careful: Market prices change over time, often precipitously. The effi cient markets hypothesis only says that it is impossible to predict market prices beyond the information compounded into current market information. 60 Chapter 2 Note that we could also apply the market valuation to other components of the right-hand side of the balance sheet—we could try to revalue the fi rm ’ s fi nancial obligations, its other liabilities, and minority interest. This is usually not done, unless there is a convincing case that the book values for these liabili- ties differ materially from their market value. 2.5 Enterprise Value (EV) as the Present Value of the Free Cash Flows: DCF “Top Down” Valuation In the previous section we valued the EV by using the market value of the right-hand side of the fi rm ’ s enterprise value balance sheet—using the market value of its equity and perhaps the market valuation of other elements of the fi rm ’ s fi nancing. In this section we concentrate on the left-hand side of the enterprise value balance sheet. The discounted cash fl ow (DCF) method focuses on two central concepts: • The fi rm ’ s free cash fl ows (FCFs) are defi ned as the cash created by the fi rm ’ s operating activities. • The fi rm ’ s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the risk-adjusted discount rate appropriate to the risk of the FCFs (Chapter 3). • The fi rm ’ s enterprise value (EV) is the present value of the future FCFs discounted at the WACC: EVFCF WACCt t t= +()=∞ ∑11 . The idea is to value a company by considering the present value of the FCFs, where FCF is defi ned as the cash fl ow to the fi rm from its assets (the word assets is used broadly, and can be fi xed assets, intellectual and trademark assets, and net working capital). The next subsection discusses this concept in more detail. • In these chapters we often make two additional assumptions: We assume a limited number of predictive periods for the FCFs and we assume that cash fl ows occur throughout the year. This leads to EVFCF WACCTerminal value WACC FCFt tN tN t= +()+ +() =−− =∑11 105 05 1.. + +()+ +()⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥ = ↑∑WACCTerminal value WACCtN tN Computed with1 1 EExcel s NPV functionWACC ′+() /dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext /horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext105. The assumption that, for valuation purposes, cash fl ows occur approxi- mately in mid-year is meant to capture the fact that most corporate cash fl ows 61 Corporate Valuation Overview occur throughout the year and that it is therefore a mistake to value them as if they occur at year-end. As can be seen from the above formula, the mid-year assumption is easy to compute in Excel: We simply take the Excel NPV and multiply it by (1 + WACC) 0.5 . Defi ning the Free Cash Flow (FCF) The free cash fl ow (FCF) is a measure of how much cash is produced by the fi rm ’ s operations. There are two accepted defi nitions of the FCF (both of which, of course, ultimately boil down to the same thing). Free Cash Flow Based on the Income Statement Profi t after taxes This is the basic measure of the profi tability of the business, but it is an accounting measure that includes fi nancing fl ows (such as interest), as well as non-cash expenses such as depreciation. Profi t after taxes does not account for either changes in the fi rm ’ s working capital or purchases of new fi xed assets, both of which can be important cash drains on the fi rm. + Depreciation and other non-cash expensesDepreciation is a non-cash expense that in the FCF calculation is added back to the profi t after tax. To the extent that there are other non-cash expenses in the fi rm ’ s income statement, these are also added back. − Increase in operating current assetsWhen the fi rm ’ s sales increase, more investment is needed in inventories, accounts receivable, etc. This increase in current assets is not an expense for tax purposes (and is therefore ignored in the profi t after taxes), but it is a cash drain on the company. When adjusting the FCF for current assets, we take care to not include fi nancial current assets that are not directly related to sales such as cash and marketable securities. + Increase in operating current liabilitiesAn increase in the sales often causes an increase in fi nancing related to sales (such as accounts payable or taxes payable). This increase in current liabilities—when related to sales—provides cash to the fi rm. Since it is directly related to sales, we include this cash in the free cash fl ow calculations. When adjusting the FCF for current liabilities, we take care to not include fi nancial current liabilities that are not directly related to sales: changes in short-term debt and the current portion of long-term debt being the most prominent examples. 62 Chapter 2 An alternative, equivalent, defi nition is based on the fi rm ’ s earnings before income and taxes: Free Cash Flow Based on the EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) EBIT + Depreciation and other non-cash expenses − Increase in Operating Current Assets The sum – Δ CA + Δ CL is the change in the fi rm ’ s net working capital Δ NWC + Increase in Operating Current Liabilities − Increase in fi xed assets at cost (CAPEX) − Increase in fi xed assets at cost (CAPEX)An increase in fi xed assets (the long-term productive assets of the company) is a use of cash, which reduces the fi rm ’ s free cash fl ow. + After-tax interest payments (net)FCF is an attempt to measure the cash produced by the business activity of the fi rm. To neutralize the effect of interest payments on the fi rm ’ s profi ts, we: • Add back the after-tax cost of interest on debt ( after-tax since interest payments are tax-deductible), • Subtract out the after-tax interest payments on cash and marketable securities. How Can We Predict Future FCFs? The most critical aspect in valuing a company is to project its anticipated future free cash fl ows. In this book we explore two ways of deriving these cash fl ows. Both methods are primarily based on accounting data. Since accounting data is historical data, we need to add some judgment about how this data will develop in the future. • One method is to base our estimates of future free cash fl ows on the con- solidated statement of cash fl ows (CSCF) of the fi rm (Chapter 4). • The second method is to estimate a set of pro forma fi nancial statements for the fi rm and to derive the free cash fl ows from these statements (Chapter 5). Both methods are briefl y reviewed in succeeding sections. 63 Corporate Valuation Overview 2.6 Free Cash Flows Based on Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (CSCF) The consolidated statement of cash fl ows is part of every fi nancial statement. It is the accountant ’ s explanation of how much cash was generated by the business, and how this cash was generated. The consolidated statement of cash fl ows (CSCF) is composed of three sections: Operating cash fl ows, investment cash fl ows, and fi nancing cash fl ows. When we use the CSCF to determine FCFs, we use the following general procedure (explanations are given in sub-sequent subsections and again in Chapter 4): • We accept the operating cash fl ows as reported by the fi rm. • We carefully examine the investment cash fl ows, leaving for the FCF the investment cash fl ows related to productive activities and eliminating those investment cash fl ows relating to investment by the fi rm in fi nancial assets. • We do not count toward the FCF any of the fi nancial cash fl ows. • In all cases we are careful about whether specifi c items are one time or recurring, eliminating from consideration the one-time items. • We adjust the totals of the adjusted CSCF numbers by adding back net inter- est paid. The subsections below contain further explanations. A worked-out example is given in the next section. CSCF, Section 1: Operating Cash Flows The operating cash fl ows adjust the fi rm ’ s net income for non-cash deductions to the income and for changes in the fi rm ’ s operating net working capital. Because modern accounting statements include many non-cash items, translat-ing the fi rm ’ s accounts to a cash basis necessitates many adjustments. A classic adjustment is to add back depreciation to the fi rm ’ s income: Since depreciation is a non-cash charge on the fi rm ’ s income, it must be added back when making the adjustment for cash. But depreciation is just the tip of the non-cash iceberg: • When fi rms issue stock options to employees, the value of these options is deducted from the fi rm ’ s income. The logic behind this—that in giving its employees options, the fi rm has given them something of value which must be accounted for in its income statement—is impeccable. But the actual charge 64 Chapter 2 for options is a non-cash deduction, and in the consolidated statement of cash fl ows, it is added back. • A fi rm ’ s income statements must refl ect the decrease in goodwill (so-called “impairment”). This impairment—the loss in economic value of an intangible asset that was purchased by the fi rm—is an economic loss to the fi rm ’ s share- holders. But it is not a cash fl ow loss, and in the consolidated statement of cash fl ows it is added back. • The list can include a large number of additional items, as we shall see in Chapter 4. For purposes of computing the fi rm ’ s free cash fl ows, we can usually leave all the items in the operating cash fl ow section of the CSCF. SCF, Section 2: Investment Cash Flows The second section of the CSCF includes all investments made by the fi rm. These investments include both investments in securities and investments in operating assets of the fi rm. • Investment in securities can refer to the sale or the purchase of securities held by the fi rm. Investment in securities is not part of the fi rm ’ s free cash fl ows, which are intended to measure solely cash fl ows related to the fi rm ’ s core business activities. • Investments in fi xed assets are usually related to the fi rm ’ s FCFs. For purposes of computing the fi rm ’ s free cash fl ows, we need to distinguish between fi nancial investment cash fl ows (not part of the FCF) and investment in assets used to produce the fi rm ’ s business income (part of the FCF).

Using the defi nition of free cash fl ows from section 2.5: 70 Chapter 2 • One approach to discounting the fi rm ’ s free cash fl ows (FCFs) bases the estimates of future FCFs on the fi rm ’ s consolidated statement of cash fl ows. These FCFs are then discounted at the appropriate weighted average cost of capital (WACC, Chapter 3). • A second approach to discounting the fi rm ’ s free cash fl ows constructs the FCFs from a model of the fi rm ’ s projected future accounting statements (pro forma accounting statements). As in the previous bullet, these FCFs are dis-counted at the WACC. Exercises 1. Three years of balance sheets for Cisco are given on the disk with this book.

(Details and template on the disk that accompanies this book.) 3 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 3.1 Overview In this chapter we discuss the calculation of the firm ’ s weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The WACC has two important uses in finance: • When used as the discount rate for a firm ’ s anticipated free cash flows (FCFs), the WACC gives the enterprise value of the firm. FCF is discussed in Chapter 2 and again at length in Chapters 4, 5, and 6—at this point it suffices to say that the FCF is the cash flow generated by the firm ’ s core business activities. These chapters also show how to apply the WACC to the valuation of firms. • The WACC is also the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate for firm projects whose riskiness is similar to the average riskiness of the firm ’ s cash flows. When used in this context, the WACC is often referred to as the firm ’ s “hurdle rate.” The WACC is a weighted average of the firm ’ s cost of equity r E and its cost of debt r D , with the weights created by the market values of the firm ’ s equity ( E ) and debt ( D ): WACCE EDrD EDrT ED C =+++−()1 where E = market value of the firm ’ s equity D = market value of the firm ’ s debt T C = firm ’ s corporate tax rate r E = firm ’ s cost of equity r D = firm ’ s cost of debt This chapter discusses the computation of the five components of the WACC—the market value of the firm ’ s equity and debt E and D , the firm ’ s tax rate T C , the firm ’ s cost of debt r D , and the cost of equity r E . We finish by showing detailed examples of how to compute the firm ’ s WACC. The reader should be warned that the application of the models discussed requires a good deal of judgment—computing the WACC is equal parts science and art! 72 Chapter 3 The main technical problem is the computation of the firm ’ s cost of equity r E . We consider two models for calculating the cost of equity r E , the discount rate applied to equity cash flows. • The Gordon model calculates the cost of equity based on the anticipated cash flows paid to the shareholders of the firm. In the implementation of the Gordon model, dividends growing at a constant future rate are most commonly used as the anticipated shareholder cash flows. We explore two variations of the model: multiple future growth rates and total equity cash flows. • The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) calculates the cost of equity based on the correlation between the firm ’ s equity returns and the returns of a large, diversified, market portfolio. Variations on this model include the tax frame-work in which the model is defined. The other problematic component of the cost of capital is the cost of debt r D , the anticipated future cost of the firm ’ s borrowing. This book contains three models to calculate the cost of debt; two of these models are discussed in this chapter and a third method is discussed separately in Chapter 28. • The cost of debt r D is most commonly computed by using the firm ’ s current net interest payments divided by its average net debt (net debt: debt minus cash and marketable securities). • An alternative method is to compute r D by imputing the firm ’ s cost of debt from a rating-adjusted yield curve. • Finally, we can compute the expected return on the firm ’ s bonds as a proxy for its cost of debt; we discuss this method separately in Chapter 28. A terminological note : “Cost of capital” is a synonym for the “appropriate discount rate” to be applied to a series of cash flows. In finance “appropriate” is most often a synonym for “risk-adjusted.” Hence another name for the cost of capital is the “risk-adjusted discount rate” (RADR). The Remainder of This Chapter In the following sections we discuss the various components of the WACC with examples of how they might be computed: • Section 3.2: Computing the equity value, E . • Section 3.3: Computing the value of the firm ’ s debt, D . 73 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) • Section 3.4: Computing the firm ’ s corporate tax rate T C . • Section 3.5: Computing the firm ’ s cost of debt, r D . • Sections 3.6–3.9: Computing the firm ’ s cost of equity, r E . We show how to use both the Gordon dividend model and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to compute r E . Each model has a number of twists and variations, discussed in these sections. • Sections 3.10–3.11: Computing the expected return on the market E ( r M ) and the risk-free rate r f in the CAPM. • Sections 3.12–3.15: Three worked-out cases of the computation of the WACC. We present a unified template that will help you make sense of the WACC computation. • Section 3.16: Discussion of problems with using the dividend model and the CAPM, including the case of the determination of the WACC for non-marketed firms. 3.2 Computing the Value of the Firm ’ s Equity, E Of all the computations related to the WACC, computing the value of the firm ’ s equity is the easiest: As long as the company is publicly listed, take E to be the product of the number of shares outstanding times the current value per share. As an example, consider El Paso Pipeline Partners (EPB), a New York Stock Exchange company that owns gas pipelines and gas storage facilities. On 29 June 2012, EPB has 205.7 million shares outstanding, each trading at $33.80. The equity value of the company is $6.953 billion. 1 1 234AB C Shares outstanding 205.70 <-- Million Share price, 29 June 2012 33.80Equity value (\"market cap\") 6,953 <-- =B3*B2, million $COMPUTING THE VALUE OF EQUITY, E, FOR EL PASO PIPELINE PARTNERS (EPB) 1. Most market traders refer to this number as the “market capitalization” or “market cap.” 74 Chapter 3 3.3 Computing the Value of the Firm ’ s Debt, D We compute the value of the firm ’ s debt by the market value of its financial debt minus the market value of its excess liquid assets. A common approxima-tion for this number is to take the balance sheet value of the firm ’ s debt minus the value of the firm ’ s cash balances and minus the value of its marketable securities. Here ’ s an example for Kroger: 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9AB C D 2011 2010 0 0 0 , 8 8 1 0 0 0 , 5 2 8 h s a C Marketable securities 0 0 Short-term and current portion of long-term debt 588,000 1,315,000 Long-term debt 7,304,000 6,850,000 Net debt 7,067,000 7,977,000 <-- =SUM(C6:C7)-SUM(C3:C4)KROGER, COMPUTING NET DEBT (thousand $) For purposes of computing the weighted average cost of capital, our defini- tion of debt excludes other debt-like items such as pension liabilities and deferred taxes. Though we consider these items as debts, it is hard to attach a cost to them; we prefer to approximate the WACC by using only financial obligations net of liquid assets. It is not uncommon for a company to have negative net debt—this occurs when the company has more cash and marketable securities than debt. When this occurs, we set D in the WACC computation to be a negative number. Both Intel and Whole Foods Markets are examples: 75 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 1 2 345 6 789 10 11 1213 14 15 1617D C B A 2010 2011 5 6 0 , 5 8 9 4 , 5 h s a C Marketable securities 16,387 9,772 Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt 38 247 Long-term debt 2,077 7,084 Net debt -19,770 -7,506 <-- =SUM(C6:C7)-SUM(C3:C4) 2010 2011 0 6 9 , 3 0 3 8 9 7 , 8 1 2 h s a C Marketable securities 329,738 442,320 Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt 410 466 Long-term debt 508,288 17,439 Net debt -39,838 -728,375 <-- =SUM(C15:C16)-SUM(C12:C13)INTEL HAS NEGATIVE NET DEBT (million $) WHOLE FOODS HAS NE GATIVE NET DEBT (thousand $) 1 234 5AB C D E 2009 2010 2011 Income before tax 250,942 411,781 551,712 Income tax expense 104,138 165,948 209,100 Tax rate, TC 41.50% 40.30% 37.90% <-- =D4/D3WHOLE FOODS MARKET TAX RATE 3.4 Computing the Firm ’ s Tax Rate, T C In the WACC formula, T C should measure the firm ’ s marginal tax rate, but it is common to measure it by computing the firm ’ s reported tax rate. Usually this should cause no problems, as the following example shows: 76 Chapter 3 The tax rate for Whole Foods is reasonably stable at 38% to 41%. In our WACC computation we would most likely use the current tax rate or the average over the past several years. Sometimes, however, this doesn ’ t work, as the following example shows: 1 2 34 5AB C D E 2009 2010 2011 Income before taxes 15,290,000 1,653,000 7,334,000 Income tax expense 2,268,000 671,000 942,000 Tax rate, TC 14.83% 40.59% 12.84% <-- =J4/J3MERCK TAX RATE Companies like Merck are very good at placing their income in comfortable tax venues, and it appears that a reasonable estimate for the tax rate is some-where between 13% and 15%. In 2010, a year of low income for Merck, these tax-planning strategies evidently did not work. Assuming that Merck ’ s future profitability is indicated by the two good years 2009 and 2011, we would most likely assume that Merck ’ s company ’ s future tax rate T C is in the range of the 2009 and 2011 tax rate. 3.5 Computing the Firm ’ s Cost of Debt, r D We now turn to calculating the cost of debt r D . In principle, r D is the marginal cost to the firm (before corporate taxes) of borrowing an additional dollar. There are at least three ways of calculating the firm ’ s cost of debt. We will state them briefly below and then go on to illustrate the application of two of the methods that although they may not be theoretically perfect are often used in practice: • As a practical matter, the cost of debt can often be approximated by taking the average cost of the firm ’ s existing debt. The problem with this method is that it runs the danger of confusing the past costs with the future anticipated cost of debt that we actually want to measure. • We can use the yield of similar-risk, newly issued corporate securities. If a company is rated A and has mostly medium-term debt, then we can use the average yield on medium-term, A-rated debt as the firm ’ s cost of debt. Note that this method is somewhat problematic because the yield on a bond is its promised return , whereas the cost of debt is the expected return on a firm ’ s 77 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) debt. Since there is usually a risk of default, the promised return is generally higher than the expected return. Nevertheless, despite the problematics, this method is often a good compromise. • We can use a model that estimates the cost of debt from data about the firm ’ s bond prices, the estimated probabilities of default, and the estimated payoffs to bondholders in case of default. This method requires a lot of work and is mathematically non-trivial; we postpone its discussion until Chapter 28. For cost of capital calculations it would be used in practice only if the firm we are analyzing has significant amounts of risky debt. The first two methods above are relatively easy to apply, and in many cases the problems or errors which are encountered in these methods are not critical. 2 As a matter of theory, however, both of these methods fail to make proper risk-adjustments for the cost of the firm ’ s debt. The third method, which involves computing the expected return on a firm ’ s debt, is more in line with standard financial theory, but it is also more difficult to apply. It may not, therefore, be worth the effort. In the remainder of this section, we apply the first two of these methods to calculate the cost of debt for U.S. Steel and Merck. Method 1: U.S. Steel ’ s Average Cost of Debt For U.S. Steel we compute the average cost of debt: rCurrent year s net interest paid Average net debt over this and pr D=’ e evious year There are several aspects of our calculations worth noting: 2. It bears repeating that calculating the cost of capital requires a large number of assumptions and does not necessarily give a precise answer. Cost of capital estimation is not a science , it is an art . Users of cost of capital estimates should always do a sensitivity analysis around the numbers calculated. Given the data on the company you are analyzing, some sloppiness in the cost of capital calculations (with its accompanying savings in time) may be expedient. 78 Chapter 3 • When calculating the average cost of debt r D from the financial statements, it is important to include all financial debt, without distinguishing between short-term and long-term items. • We treat liquid assets such as cash and cash equivalents as negative debt and subtract them from the firm ’ s debt. The idea here is that the firm could use its cash to pay off part of its debt, so that the effective debt financing of the firm is its financial debt minus cash. However, the implementation of this particular piece of theory is largely a judgment call—we may not want to attribute all cash to the possibility of paying off debt, and we may want to compute the firm ’ s cost of borrowing as opposed to the interest it earns on cash. Were we to use the average cost of debt for U.S. Steel as a prediction of its future cost of debt r D , we would most likely use the current cost r D = 4.90% in the WACC computation. This is because we believe that historical costs of debt have little predictive power for future costs. Cash Raises the Cost of Debt: The Case of Merck When a firm has cash balances that earn less interest than the cost of borrow-ing, the average cost of debt, based on net interest and net debt is higher than the cost of borrowing. To see this, assume that the interest rate on cash is less by ε than the interest rate paid on debt:2 3 456 7 8 9 1011 12AB C D E 2009 2010 2011 0 0 0 , 8 0 4 0 0 0 , 8 7 5 0 0 0 , 8 1 2 , 1 h s a C Short-term investments 0 0 0 Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt 19,000 216,000 400,000 Long-term debt 3,828,000 3,517,000 3,345,000 ) 4 D : 3 D ( M U S - ) 7 D : 6 D ( M U S = - - < 0 0 0 , 7 3 3 , 3 0 0 0 , 5 5 1 , 3 0 0 0 , 9 2 6 , 2 t b e d t e N 0 0 0 , 9 5 1 0 0 0 , 5 9 1 0 0 0 , 0 9 1 t s e r e t n I Implied cost of debt, rD 6.74% 4.90% <-- =D10/AVERAGE(C9:D9)UNITED STATES STEEL, COST OF DEBT 79 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 1 2 34 5 6 7 8 9 1011 1213 14 15 16 17 18E D C B A 2009 2010 2011 0 0 0 , 1 3 5 , 3 1 0 0 0 , 0 0 9 , 0 1 0 0 0 , 1 1 3 , 9 h s a C Short-term investment s 293,000 1,301,000 1,441,000 Total liquid assets 9,604,000 12, 201,000 14,972,000 <-- =D4+D3 Short-term debt and current portion of long-term debt 1,379,000 2,400,000 1,990,000 Long-term debt 16,095, 000 15,482,000 15,525,000 Total financial debt 17,474,000 17, 882,000 17,515,000 <-- =D7+D8 5 D - 9 D = - - < 0 0 0 , 3 4 5 , 2 0 0 0 , 1 8 6 , 5 0 0 0 , 0 7 8 , 7 t b e d t e N Interest income 210,000 83,000 199,000 Interest expense 460,000 715,000 749,000 2 1 D - 3 1 D = - - < 0 0 0 , 0 5 5 0 0 0 , 2 3 6 0 0 0 , 0 5 2 t s e r e t n i t e N Implied cost of debt, r D 9.33% 13.38% <-- =D14/AVERAGE(C11:D11) ) ) 4 C : 3 C ( M U S , ) 4 D : 3 D ( M U S ( E G A R E V A / 2 1 D = - - < % 6 4 . 1 % 6 7 . 0 d e n r a e e t a r t s e r e t n I ) ) 8 C : 7 C ( M U S , ) 8 D : 7 D ( M U S ( E G A R E V A / 3 1 D = - - < % 3 2 . 4 % 4 0 . 4 d i a p e t a r t s e r e t n IMERCK, COST OF DEBT r D Average cost of debtInterest paid Interest earned Debt Cash Deb=− − =tt i Cash i Debt CashDebt i Cash i DebtDebt Cash Debt Debt ∗− ∗ −=∗− ∗ − () ε − − =− () ∗+ ∗ − =+−Cash Debt Cash i Cash Debt Cash iCash Debt CaDebt Debtε sshiDebt ∗>ε Here ’ s a somewhat dramatic example for Merck: In 2011 Merck ’ s cost of borrowing was 4.23%, and the company earned a respectable 1.46% on its massive reserves of cash and short-term investments.

From a purely financial point of view, Merck would have benefited its shareholders by using the liquid assets 80 Chapter 3 to repurchase its debt or by paying them out as either dividends or share repurchases. 3 What number would we choose to represent the marginal cost of borrowing in the WACC equation? In large measure this depends on how we view the financial policy of Merck: If we view the firm as proceeding to build up cash reserves, while at the same time maintaining large amounts of financial debt, then 13.38% might be a reasonable measure of the cost of debt. If, on the other hand, we view the marginal debt financing of Merck as being with debt, without a parallel buildup of cash, then a number around 4% would better represent r D . 4 Method 2: r D as the Rating-Adjusted Yield for Merck There is another way to measure the cost of debt for Merck ’ s borrowing: We can impute the marginal cost of Merck ’ s debt from a yield curve for the appro-priate debt. Merck is rated A + by Fitch, BBB + by Standard and Poor ’ s, and BAA2 by Moody ’ s.

This statement ignores the option value of the liquid assets: their ability to provide Merck with financial flexibility. 4. In the case of Merck, as we shall see in section 3.14, none of this makes much difference, since Merck is virtually an all-equity company. 81 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) Graphing these data shows either that these data cover a wide range of true credit risks or that the market is far from efficient: y = 8E-06x3- 0.0004x2+ 0.008x + 0.0005 R² = 0.4895 -2%0%2%4%6%8%10% 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35Term Structure, A Bonds, 17 August 2012 Bond maturity 1 2 3C B A Average time to maturity (years) 7 5 0 0 0 . 0 + 2 B * 8 0 0 . 0 + 2 ^ 2 B * 4 0 0 0 . 0 - 3 ^ 2 B * 8 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 = - - < % 6 9 . 3 d l e i YCOMPUTING MERCK'S r D FROM THE A-YIELD CURVE The polynomial regression line describes about 50% of the variability of the yields as a function of the time to maturity. Using this regression equation and assuming a 7-year average maturity for Merck ’ s debt, the cost of borrow-ing for Merck is 3.96%. 82 Chapter 3 3.6 Two Approaches to Computing the Firm ’ s Cost of Equity, r E The equation for the weighted average cost of capital is WACC = E /( E + D )* r E + E /( E + D )* r D *(1 − T C ). Thus far in this chapter we have discussed the esti- mation of four of the five parameters of the WACC equation: E , D , T C , r D . We now come to the most problematic of the computations related to the WACC parameters—the computation of the cost of equity r E . There are two approaches to r E that can readily be computed: • The Gordon dividend model computes r E based on current dividend Div 0 , current stock price P 0 , and the anticipated growth of future dividends g : rDiv g Pg E=+()+0 01 • The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) computes r E based on the risk-free rate r f , the expected return on the market E ( r M ), and a firm-specific risk measure β : rr E r rEf M f=+ () − []β where r f = the market risk-free rate of interest E ( r M ) = the expected return on the market portfolio β = a firm-specific risk measure = Cov r r Var rstock M M, () () Each model has its variations and problems, which are discussed ( ad nauseam ?) in the next two sections. 3.7 Implementing the Gordon Model for r E The Gordon dividend model derives the cost of equity from the following deceptively simple statement: The value of a share is the present value of the future anticipated dividend stream from the share, where the future anticipated dividends are discounted at the appropriate risk-adjusted cost of equity r E . 5 5. This model is named after M. J. Gordon, who first published this formula in a paper entitled “Dividends, Earnings and Stock Prices,” Review of Economics and Statistics . 83 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) The simplest application of the Gordon model is the case where the antici- pated future growth rate of dividends is constant. Suppose that the current stock price is P 0 , the current dividend is Div 0 , and the anticipated growth rate of future dividends is g . The Gordon model states that the stock price equals the discounted (at the appropriate cost of equity r E ) future dividends: PDiv g rDiv g rDiv g rDiv E EE0012 213 31 11 11 1=+() ++∗+() +()+∗+() +()+1 14 4 0 11 1 1 1∗+() +() =∗+() +() =∞ ∑g r Div g rE t Et t… Provided that | g | < r E , the expression Div g rt Et t0 11 1∗+() +() =∞ ∑ can be reduced to Div g rgE01+() − (we will spare you this derivation, which is based on a formula for geometric series usually studied in high school). Thus—given a constant anticipated dividend growth rate, we derive the Gordon model cost of equity: PDiv g rggr EE 001=+() −< , provided Solving the above equation for r E gives the Gordon formula for the cost of equity: rDiv g Pgg r EE=+()+<0 01, provided Note the proviso at the end of this formula: In order for the infinite sum on the first line of the formula to have a finite solution, the growth rates of the dividends must be less than the discount rate. In our discussion of the Gordon model with supernormal growth rates (see below) we return to the case where this is not true. To apply this formula, consider a firm whose current dividend is Div 0 = $3 per share, whose share price is P 0 = $50. Suppose the dividend is anticipated to grow by 12% per year. Then the firm ’ s cost of equity r E is 17.6%: 84 Chapter 3 1 2 3 4 5C B A Current share price, P 0 60 Current dividend, Div 0 3 Anticipated dividend growth rate, g 12% Gordon model cost of equity, r E 17.60% <-- =B3*(1+B4)/B2+B4THE GORDON MODEL COST OF EQUITY 1 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 1011 12 40 41 42 43AB C D E F DateDividend per share 4-Sep-02 0.36 4-Dec-02 0.36 Quarterly growth 0.39% <-- =(B43/B3)^(1/40)-1 5-Mar-03 0.36 Annual growth 1.55% <-- =(1+E4)^4-1 4-Jun-03 0.36 20-Aug-03 2.88 3-Sep-03 0.37 Quarterly growth 0.50% <-- =(B43/B23)^(1/20)-1 3-Dec-03 0.37 Annual growth 2.02% <-- =(1+E8)^4-1 3-Mar-04 0.37 2-Jun-04 0.37 1-Sep-04 0.38 13-Sep-11 0.38 13-Dec-11 0.42 13-Mar-12 0.42 13-Jun-12 0.42Dividend growth Whole period Last 5 yearsMERCK DIVIDEND HISTORY Using the Gordon Model to Compute the Cost of Equity for Merck We apply the Gordon model to Merck, whose 10-year dividend history is given below (note that some of the data has been hidden): The annualized growth rate of Merck ’ s historical dividends may be either 1.55% or 2.02%, depending on the period taken. For purposes of computing the cost of equity r E , the question is which of these rates better predicts future anticipated dividend growth rates. 6 In the spreadsheet below, we allow for both possibilities. The calculations use Merck ’ s stock price at the end of June 2012, P 0 = $41.75: 6. Or perhaps neither does! Perhaps we are better off using another story altogether to predict future anticipated dividend growth? We could use a pro forma model (discussed in Chapter 5) to predict the firm ’ s anticipated dividend payout. 85 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 1 2 3 4 5 6 789 10 11 12C B A Merck stock price P 0, 29 June 2012 10-Feb-00 Current dividend 2 4 . 0 y l r e t r a u Q Annualized dividend, Div 0 1.68 <-- =4*B4 Dividend growth rate, g % 5 5 . 1 s r a e y 5 t s a L % 2 0 . 2 s r a e y 0 1 t s a L Gordon model cost of equity, r E Using last 5 years' growth 5.64% <-- =$B$5/$B$2*(1+B7)+B7 Using last 10 years' growth 6.13% <-- =$B$5/$B$2*(1+B8)+B8COMPUTING MERCK'S r E WITH THE GORDON MODEL For all practical purposes, given the margin of error in our estimates of the future, these numbers are identical—remember that we are trying to predict future dividend growth based on past dividend payouts. Adjusting the Gordon Model to Account for All Cash Flows to Equity As illustrated above, the Gordon model is computed on a per-share basis and for dividends only. However, for purposes of valuing the firm ’ s equity, the Gordon model should be extended to include all cash flows to equity. In addi-tion to dividends, cash flows to equity include at least two additional components: • Share repurchases now account for around 50% of the total cash disbursed by American corporations to their shareholders. 7 • The issuance of stock by the firm is an important negative cash flow to equity . In many firms the most important instance of stock issuance is the exercise by employees of their stock options. In order to account for these additional cash flows to equity, we have to rewrite the Gordon model in terms of total equity value. The basic valuation model of Gordon now becomes: Market value of equityCash flow to equity g rt Et t=∗+() +() =∞ ∑0 11 1 7.

In the next subsection we present another variation of the Gordon model that may provide an answer. “Supernormal Growth” and the Gordon Model A basic condition of the Gordon formula rDiv g Pg E=+()+0 01 is the condition | g | < r E . 9 In finance examples, violations of | g | < r E usually occur for very fast-growing firms, in which—at least for short periods of time—we anticipate very high growth rates, so that g > r E . If such “supernormal” growth were the case in the long run, the original dividend discount formula shows that P 0 would have an infinite value, since, when g > r E , the expression Div g rt Et t0 11 1∗+() +()=∞ =∞ ∑ . Thus a period of very high dividend growth rates (where g > r E ) must be followed by a period in which the long-term growth rate of dividends is less than the cost of equity, g < r E . Suppose that the firm is anticipated to pay high-growth dividends during periods 1, … , m , and that for subsequent periods the growth rate of dividends will be lower. We can write the discounted value of these anticipated future dividends as: Share value today Present value of dividends Div g rt E= =∗+ +()011 1() t t tm m gD = ↑∑ + 1 1PV of years of high-growth dividends/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketextiiv g rtm Et tm g52 11 1∗+ +()− =+∞ ↑∑() PV of remaining normal-growth2 2dividends/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext The problem is usually to determine the cost of equity r E from predicted growth rates. In the example below we use a VBA function TwoStageGordon to compute r E that equalizes the values of both sides of the above equation. 10 The assumption is that a firm ’ s share price is currently P 0 = 30, that its current dividend is Div 0 = 3, and that after 5 years of 35% growth in dividends, the dividend growth rate will slow to 8%. As you can see below, r E = 32.76%. 8. Most firms only report stock repurchases and employee stock exercises annually. Thus the only data available for these numbers is annual data, whereas dividends are reported quarterly and stock price data—used to compute the CAPM beta discussed in section 3.9—are available on a daily basis. 9. In this section we interpret Div 0 in the Gordon formula to denote either dividends per share or total equity payouts. 10. The construction of TwoStageGordon is discussed at the end of this section. 88 Chapter 3 1 2 34 5 67C B A Current dividend, Div 0 3.00 Growth rate g 1, years 1-m (\"supernormal\") 35% Growth rate g 2, years 6 - ∞ 8% Number of supernormal growth years, m 5 0 0 . 0 3 e c i r p e r a h S ) 4 B , 5 , 3 B , 2 B , 6 B ( n o d r o g e g a t s o w t = - - < % 6 7 . 2 3 y t i u q e f o t s o CTHE GORDON MODEL WITH TWO GROWTH RATES Using the TwoStageGordon function Implementing the Two-Stage Gordon Model for Merck Below we use the two-stage model to compute the cost of equity for Merck. We assume that the 5-year growth rate of total equity payouts of 13.71% will hold only for the next 2 years, and that afterward the growth rate of equity payouts will be 5%.

It is also the most widely used cost of equity model, the reasons being both its theoretical elegance and 90 Chapter 3 its implementational simplicity. The CAPM derives the firm ’ s cost of capital from its covariance with the market return. 11 The classic CAPM formula for the firm ’ s cost of equity is: rr E r rEf M f=+ () − []β where r f = the market risk-free rate of interest E ( r M ) = the expected return on the market portfolio β = a firm-specific risk measure = Cov r r Var rstock M M, () () In the remainder of this section we focus on measuring the firm ’ s β ; the next section shows how to apply the CAPM to find the firm ’ s cost of equity r E . Beta Is the Regression Coefficient of the Firm ’ s Stock Returns on the Market Returns In the following spreadsheet, we show the 5 years of monthly prices and returns for Merck and for the S&P 500, which we take to proxy for the stock market as a whole.

The CAPM is discussed in detail in Chapters 8–11. At this point we outline the application of the model to finding the cost of capital without entering into the theory. 91 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 1 2 345678 9 10 111213141516 17 18 192021222324252627 28 29AB C D E F G Alpha 0.0018 <-- =INTERCEPT(E11:E70,F11:F70) ) 0 7 F : 1 1 F , 0 7 E : 1 1 E ( E P O L S = - - < 5 3 4 6 . 0 a t e B R-squared 0.2245 <-- =RSQ(E11:E70,F11:F70) t-statistic for alpha 0.2059 <-- =tintercept(E11:E70,F11:F70) t-statistic for beta 4.0979 <-- =tslope(E11:E70,F11:F70) Date Merck SP500 Merck SP500 1-Jun-07 39.90 1,503.35 2-Jul-07 39.78 1,455.27 -0.30% -3.25% <-- =LN(C11/C10) 1-Aug-07 40.20 1,473.99 1.05% 1.28% <-- =LN(C12/C11) 4-Sep-07 41.73 1,526.75 3.74% 3.52% <-- =LN(C13/C12) 1-Oct-07 47.04 1,549.38 11.98% 1.47% 1-Nov-07 47.93 1,481.14 1.87% -4.50% 3-Dec-07 47.23 1,468.36 -1.47% -0.87% 2-Jan-08 37.47 1,378.55 -23.15% -6.31% 1-Feb-08 36.00 1,330.63 -4.00% -3.54% 3-Mar-08 31.11 1,322.70 -14.60% -0.60% 1-Apr-08 31.19 1,385.59 0.26% 4.65% 1-May-08 31.94 1,400.38 2.38% 1.06% 2-Jun-08 31.21 1,280.00 -2.31% -8.99% 1-Jul-08 27.24 1,267.38 -13.61% -0.99% 1-Aug-08 29.54 1,282.83 8.11% 1.21% 2-Sep-08 26.42 1,166.36 -11.16% -9.52% 1-Oct-08 25.91 968.75 -1.95% -18.56% 3-Nov-08 22.37 896.24 -14.69% -7.78% 1-Dec-08 25.82 903.25 14.34% 0.78% 2-Jan-09 24.25 825.88 -6.27% -8.95%COMPUTING THE BETA FOR MERCK monthly returns for Merck and SP500, 2007-2012 s n r u t e R s e c i r P y = 0.6435x + 0.0018 R² = 0.2245 -25%-22%-19%-16%-13%-10%-7%-4%-1%2%5%8%11%14%17% -20% -17% -14% -11% -8% -5% -2% 1% 4% 7% 10% Merck SP500Merck return vs SP500, 2007-2012 Here ’ s what we can learn from this regression: • Merck ’ s beta, β Merck , shows the sensitivity of its stock return to the market return. It is calculated by the following formula: βMerckCovariance SP returns Merck returns Variance SP r=()500 500, eeturns () We can compute β either by using the formula above directly (cell B5 above) or by using the Excel Slope function (cell B4). Over the period covered, a 1% increase or decrease in the monthly returns of the S&P 500 was accompanied by a 0.6435% increase or decrease in Merck ’ s returns. The statistic TSlope 92 Chapter 3 (cell B6) shows that the β Merck is highly significant (see below for how this function was constructed). 12 • Intel ’ s alpha, α Merck , shows that irrespective of changes in the S&P 500, the monthly return on Intel over the period was α Merck = 0.18%. On an annual basis, this is 12*0.18 = 2.18%; this seems to indicate that, in the jargon of financial markets, Merck had positive performance over the period. Note, however, the TIntercept (cell B5): This function (its construction in Excel is discussed below) shows that the negative intercept is not significantly different from zero. • The R 2 of the regression shows that 22.45% of the variation in Merck ’ s returns is accounted for by variability in the S&P 500. An R 2 of 22% may seem low, but in the CAPM literature this is not uncommon. It says that roughly 22% of the variation in Merck ’ s returns is explicable by the variation in the S&P 500 return. The rest of the variability in the Merck returns can be diversified away by including Merck shares in a diversified portfolio of shares. The average R 2 for stocks is approximately 30% to 40%, meaning that market factors account for approximately this percentage of a stock ’ s variability, with factors idiosyncratic to the stock accounting for the rest. Merck ’ s R 2 , as you can see, is a bit on the low side—meaning that it has more idiosyncratic risk than an average stock. The spreadsheet that accompanies this chapter shows three ways of doing the regression: One way is to use the functions Intercept , Slope , Rsq . A second method involves using the Excel functions Covar and VarP . A third way involves Excel ’ s Trendline function. Having graphed the returns of Intel and the SP500 on an XY Scatter plot, we then do the following: 12. For the precise meaning of a t -statistic, you should refer to a good statistics text. For our purposes—a t -statistic over 1.96 indicates that with 95% probability the variable under discussion (when using TIntercept this is the intercept, or when using TSlope this is the slope) is signifi- cantly different from zero. Thus the t -statistic for the intercept of –0.2059 indicates that the intercept is not significantly different from zero, whereas the t -statistic for the slope of 4.0979 indicates that the slope is significantly different from zero. 93 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) Figure 3.1 The sequence of commands for producing regression results from the XY Scatter Plot in Excel. Having marked the points, we right-click to select Add Trendline (left panel). We choose the linear regression (middle panel) and indicate that the regression equation and the R 2 should be printed on the graph. The Home-Made Functions TIntercept and TSlope The spreadsheet above uses two functions to compute the t -statistics for the intercept and slope. These functions are built on the Linest function discussed in Chapter 33. Applying Linest to the return data, we get: 9 10 111213141516 17L K J I Slope Intercept Slope --> 0.6435 0.0018 <-- Intercept Standard error of slope --> 0.1570 0.0088 <-- Standard error of intercept R-squared --> 0.2245 0.0682 <-- Standard error of y values F statistic --> 16.7925 58.0000 <-- Degrees of freedom SSxy --> 0.0781 0.2696 <-- SSE = Residual sum of squaresCells J13:K17created with the formula {=LINEST(E11:E70,F11:F70,,1)} By using the Excel function Index we define a VBA function TIntercept which divides the value of the intercept term produced by Linest (first row, second column of Linest output) by the standard error of the intercept (second row, second column). Here ’ s the function for the t -statistic for the intercept: 94 Chapter 3 Function tintercept(yarray, xarray) tintercept = Application.Index(Application. _ LinEst(yarray, xarray, , 1), 1, 2) / _ Application.Index(Application.LinEst(yarray, _ xarray, , 1), 2, 2) End Function Both of these functions are embedded in the spreadsheet for this chapter. Using Excel ’ s Data Analysis Add-In There ’ s a fourth way to produce the regression output: By clicking on Tools|Data Analysis|Regression , we can use a sophisticated Excel routine that computes more statistics, including the t -statistics. The output produced by this routine is illustrated below: Similarly we can define a function TSlope that gives the t -statistic for the slope: Function tslope(yarray, xarray) tslope = Application.Index(Application. _ LinEst(yarray, xarray, , 1), 1, 1) / _ Application.Index(Application.LinEst(yarray, _ xarray, , 1), 2, 1) End Function 95 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20IJ K L M N O P Q SUMMARY OUTPUT Regression Statistics Multiple R 0.473836264 R Square 0.224520805 Adjusted R Square 0.211150474 Standard Erro r 0.068184238 Observations 60 ANOV A df SS MS F Significance F 2 3 2 1 3 1 0 0 0 . 0 5 2 4 6 4 2 9 7 . 6 1 3 8 6 9 6 0 8 7 0 . 0 3 8 6 9 6 0 8 7 0 . 0 1 n o i s s e r g e R 9 0 9 4 6 4 0 0 . 0 4 2 7 4 6 9 6 2 . 0 8 5 l a u d i s e R 3 2 9 6 1 7 7 4 3 . 0 9 5 l a t o T Coefficients Standard Error t Stat P-value Lower 95% Upper 95% Lower 95.0% Upper 95.0% Intercept 0.001813136 0.008806331 0.205890007 0.837597818 -0.015814651 0.019440922 -0.015814651 0.019440922 X Variable 1 0.643502885 0.157033851 4.097860936 0.000131232 0.329165479 0.957840291 0.329165479 0.957840291 We used Data|Data Analysis|Regression to produce this output. The set- tings are shown below: While Data|Data Analysis|Regression produces a lot of data, it has one major drawback: The output is not automatically updated when the underlying data changes. For this reason we prefer to use the other methods illustrated. 96 Chapter 3 3.9 Using the Security Market Line (SML) to Calculate Merck ’ s Cost of Equity, r E In the capital asset pricing model, the security market line (SML) is used to calculate the risk-adjusted cost of capital. In this section we consider two SML formulations. The difference between these two methods has to do with the way taxes are incorporated into the cost of capital equation. Method 1: The Classic SML The classic CAPM formula uses a security market line (SML) equation that ignores taxes: Cost of equity r r E r r Ef M f,=+ () − []β Here r f is the risk-free rate of return in the economy and E ( R M ) is the expected rate of return on the market. The choice of values for the SML parameters is often problematic. A common approach is to choose: • r f equal to the risk-free interest rate in the economy (for example, the yield on Treasury bills). We leave the question of whether to use the short-term or long-term rate open until section 3.11. For the moment, for illustrative pur-poses, we use r f = 2%. • E ( r M ) equal to the historic average of the market return, defined as the average return of a broad-based market portfolio. There is an alternative approach based on market multiples; both of these are discussed below. For the current section, we use E ( r M ) = 8%. The following spreadsheet illustrates the classic CAPM cost of equity com- putation for Merck ’ s cost of equity: 1 2 3 4 5AB C Merck beta, β 0.6435 Risk-free rate, r f 2.00% Expected market return, E(r M) 8.00% Merck cost of equity, r E 5.86% <-- =B3+B2*(B4-B3)COMPUTING THE COST OF EQUITY FOR MERCK Classic CAPM: r E = r f + b*[E(r M) - r f] 97 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) Method 2: The Tax-Adjusted SML The classic CAPM approach makes no allowance for taxation. Benninga-Sarig (1997) show that the SML has to be adjusted for the marginal corporate tax rate in the economy. 13 Denoting the corporate tax rate by T C , the tax-adjusted SML is: Cost of equity r T E r r T fC M fC=−() + () −−() [] 11 β This formula can be applied by substituting r f (1 − T C ) for r f in the classic CAPM. Note that the Tax-adjusted cost of equity has a lower intercept and a higher slope than the classic CAPM: • The intercept is r f (1 − T C ) instead of r f . This intercept is lower than the r f intercept of the classic CAPM. • The slope is E ( r M ) − r f (1 − T C ) instead of E ( r M ) − r f . This slope can be written as the classic CAPM slope plus T C r f : E ( r M ) − r f (1 − T C ) = [ E ( r M ) − r f ] + T C r f Another way to write the tax-adjusted cost of equity is: Tax adjusted cost of equityrT E r rT rE rfC M fC f-=−() + ()−−() [] =+11 β β MMf rCf rT r E()− [] +− [] ↑ Classic CAPM /dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketextβ1 This rewriting makes clear that the difference between the classic r E and the tax-adjusted r E is a function of the corporate tax rate T C , the risk-free rate r f , and the equity beta β . 14 For Merck, the tax-adjusted approach gives a somewhat higher cost of equity: 13. The logic of the Benninga-Sarig approach is outlined in our book Corporate Finance: A Valu- ation Approach (McGraw-Hill, 1997). A more formal derivation of the model is given in “Risk, Returns and Values in the Presence of Differential Taxation,” co-authored with Oded Sarig. Journal of Banking and Finance , 2003. 14. As this book is written, short-term, risk-free rates are close to zero, so that the difference between the tax-adjusted and classic CAPM is minimal. Presumably this will change at some point in the future. 98 Chapter 3 Although the tax-adjusted CAPM is more consistent with an economy with taxation, we confess that—given the uncertainties surrounding cost of capital computations—the difference between the classic CAPM and the tax-adjusted CAPM may not be worth the trouble. 3.10 Three Approaches to Computing the Expected Return on the Market, E ( r M ) Two critical questions remain in the computation of the cost of equity r E using the CAPM: • What is the expected return on the market, E ( r M )? Should it be computed from historical data? (And if so, how long should the data series be?) Or perhaps it can be computed from current market data without resort to history? • What is the risk-free rate, r f ? Should it be a short-term or a long-term rate? In this section we deal with the first question, leaving the computation of r f for section 3.11. There are three major approaches to computing E ( r M ): • The historical return on a major market index • The historical market risk premium on the market index • The Gordon model All three approaches are illustrated in this section, and their effect on comput- ing Merck ’ s cost of equity is illustrated at the end of this section. 1 2 3 45 6C B A Merck beta, β 0.6435 Merck tax rate, TC 12.84% <-- ='Merck tax rate'!D5 Risk-free rate, r f 2.00% Expected market return, E(r M) 8.45% Merck tax-adjusted cost of equity, rE 6.06% <-- =B4*(1-B3)+B2*(B5-B4*(1-B3))COMPUTING THE COST OF EQUITY FOR MERCK Tax-adjusted CAPM: r E = r f*(1-T C) + b*[E(r M) - r f*(1-T C)] 99 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 15. The Vanguard fund ’ s prices incorporate dividends on the S&P 500. Many index figures (such as those available for ∧ GSPC on Yahoo) do not incorporate dividends. E ( r M ) as the Historical Average Return on a Market Portfolio A simple approach to computing E ( r M ) is to take it as the average of the his- torical returns of a major market index. In the computation below we illustrate this approach by using Vanguard ’ s 500 Index Fund as a proxy for the market. 15 The annualized return on this fund since 1987 is 8.27%. We can take this as a reliable proxy for the historical annual average return from holding the S&P 500: 1 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 10 111213 293294295 296 297298299300301302303304 305 306307308309310311D C B A Average monthly return 0.69% <-- =AVERAGE(C10:C311) Monthly standard deviation 4.58% <-- =STDEV(C10:C311) Annualized return 8.27% <-- =12*B2 Annualized standard deviation 15.87% <-- =SQRT(12)*B3 Date Price Return 1-Apr-87 15.66 1-May-87 15.82 1.02% <-- =LN(B10/B9) 1-Jun-87 16.62 4.93% <-- =LN(B11/B10) 1-Jul-87 17.44 4.82% <-- =LN(B12/B11) 3-Aug-87 18.11 3.77% <-- =LN(B13/B12) 1-Dec-10 113.11 6.46% 3-Jan-11 115.77 2.32% 1-Feb-11 119.73 3.36% 1-Mar-11 119.76 0.03% 1-Apr-11 123.29 2.90% 2-May-11 121.88 -1.15% 1-Jun-11 119.84 -1.69% 1-Jul-11 117.39 -2.07% 1-Aug-11 110.99 -5.61% 1-Sep-11 103.16 -7.32% 3-Oct-11 114.42 10.36% 1-Nov-11 114.15 -0.24% 1-Dec-11 115.32 1.02% 3-Jan-12 120.47 4.37% 1-Feb-12 125.66 4.22% 1-Mar-12 129.78 3.23% 2-Apr-12 128.95 -0.64% 1-May-12 121.19 -6.21% 1-Jun-12 125.55 3.53%MEASURING E(r M) USING HISTORICAL DATA Derived from prices for the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (symbol: VFINX) These prices include dividends; April 1987 - June 2012 100 Chapter 3 Computing the Market Risk Premium E ( r M ) − r f Directly We can also compute the market risk premium directly.

Since the data can be taken as an ex-ante return, the April 1987 rate is attributed to May 1987. I've used 3-month instead of 1-month, because there are lots of data problems with the latter. Applying the risk premium directly to the computation of Merck ’ s cost of equity gives a cost of equity r E close to 5% (note that we still haven ’ t settled the question of r f ): 101 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) 1 2 3 456 7 89 10AB C Merck beta, β 0.6435 <-- =Page96!B2 E(rM) derived from SP price/earnings 4.40% <-- =Page100!B5 Merck tax rate, T C 12.84% <-- =Page98!B3 Risk free rate, r f 2.00% <-- Still to be discussed Intel cost of equity, r E,Intel Classic CAPM 4.83% <-- =B5+B2*B3 Tax-adjusted CAPM 4.74% <-- =B5*(1-B4)+B2*(B3+B4*B5)COMPUTING THE COST OF EQUITY FOR MERCK USING THE MARKET RISK PREMIUM E(r M) - r f Note : The tax-adjusted model in cell B8 uses the equivalence: E(rM) - r f (1-T C) = E(r M) - r f + T C*rf For the low levels of taxes and low r f in this example, there is virtually no difference between the two approaches. Calculating the Expected Return on the Market Using the Gordon Model Setting E ( r M ) = 4.40% approximates the historic market return in the United States for 1987–2012. Historic averages are appropriate if we think that the future anticipated rates of return will correspond to the historic average. On the other hand, we may want to take current market data to calculate directly the future anticipated market yield. We can do this computation by using the Gordon model. Recall from section 3.6 that the model says that the cost of equity r E is given by: rDiv g Pg E=+()+0 01 This formula also applies to the market portfolio, so that we can write: rDiv g Pg M=+()+0 01 , interpreting Div 0 , P 0 , and g to be the current dividend, price, and growth rate of the market portfolio. Assume that the firm pays out a constant proportion a of its earnings as dividends; then, indicating by EPS 0 the current earnings per share, Div 0 = a*EPS 0 . Interpreting g to be the earnings growth of the firm, we can write: EraE P S g Pgag PE P Sg M() =∗+ ()+=∗+()+0 00 011 / The term on the right-hand side of this equation, P 0 /EPS 0 , is the price earnings ratio of the market. We can use this formula to compute E ( r M ), and thus tie the cost of equity to currently observable market parameters. Here is an implementation: 102 Chapter 3 In the remainder of this chapter, we will use this estimate for E ( r M ). 3.11 What ’ s the Risk-Free Rate r f in the CAPM? Opinions about this seem to differ widely. Some authors suggest using a short- term rate, while others use a middle- or long-term rate. The author of this book has been guilty of making both suggestions, though at the current writing he believes that you should use the short-term rate. 16 For the examples in this chapter, here is some data from Yahoo/Finance on 29 June 2012: 16. Reason: Since the CAPM should apply to all risky assets, it should also apply to bonds (even default-free bonds like Treasuries, which are risky since they suffer significant price fluctuations). This suggests that the β of a risky asset impounds its risk, including the holding period risk, and that the proper risk-free rate r f is a short-term rate. But in 1997 in my book Principles of Corporate Finance: A Valuation Approach (with Oded Sarig), we advocated using a mid- to long-term Treasury rate for r f . As Emerson said: “A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines” (Emerson forgot academics …). 3.12 Computing the WACC, Three Cases In the succeeding sections we compute the WACC for three companies: Merck, Whole Foods, and Caterpillar.

These three examples, for Merck, Whole Foods, and Caterpillar, illustrate different situations and also how much ad hocery there is in the computations of the WACC. 17 3.13 Computing the WACC for Merck (MRK) We have discussed Merck ’ s cost of equity r E and cost of debt r D in previous sections.

In this case we take the average of the two latter com- putations (our general preference is often for CAPM over the dividend models). 3.16 When Don ’ t the Models Work? All models have problems and nothing is perfect. 18 In this section we discuss some of the potential problems with the Gordon model and with the capital asset pricing model. Problems with the Gordon Model Obviously the Gordon model doesn ’ t work if a firm doesn ’ t pay dividends and appears to have no intention—in the immediate future—of paying dividends. 19 But even for dividend-paying firms, it may be difficult to apply the model. Particularly problematic, in many cases, is the extraction of the future dividend payout rate from past dividends. Consider, for example, the dividend history of Ford Motor Company in the years 1989–1998: 1 23 4 56 7 89 10111213 14AB C Year Dividend 1989 3.00 1990 3.00 1991 1.95 1992 1.60 1993 1.60 1994 1.33 1995 1.23 1996 1.46 1997 1.64 1998 22.81 Growth rate, 1989-1997 -7.27% <-- =(B11/B3)^(1/8)-1 Growth rate, 1989-1998 25.28% <-- =(B12/B3)^(1/9)-1FORD MOTOR CO. DIVIDEND HISTORY 1989-1998 18. “Happiness is the maximum agreement of reality and desire.”—Stalin. 19. Firms cannot intend never to pay dividends, because such an intention would rationally mean that the value of the shares is zero. 110 Chapter 3 The problem here is easily identifiable: Ford, whose dividends were in steady decline until 1997, paid a cash dividend of $21.09 in 1998, this in addi- tion to its regular quarterly dividends (which summed to $1.72 in 1998). If we use past history to predict the future, any inclusion of the extraordinary cash dividend will cause us to overestimate the future dividend growth. Excluding the $21.09 dividend, however, also does not reflect the actual situation. It appears that the 10-year history of Ford ’ s dividends is not, perhaps, the best guide to its future dividend payout. There are several solutions to those wishing to use the Gordon model: • If we exclude the extraordinary dividend of $21.09 in 1998, then the divi- dend growth over the 4 years ending in 1998 is a respectable 6.64%. If Ford ’ s anticipated future dividend growth is estimated to be this rate, then—given its end-1998 stock price of $58.69—the Gordon model cost of equity is 9.77%: 17 18 19 2021 22 2324 25 2627 28 2930 31AB C Year Dividend 1989 3.00 1990 3.00 1991 1.95 1992 1.60 1993 1.60 1994 1.33 1995 1.23 1996 1.46 1997 1.64 1998 1.72 Growth rate, 1994-1998 6.64% <-- =(B28/B24)^(1/4)-1 Ford's stock price, end-1998 58.69Gordon cost of equity 9.77% <-- =B28*(1+B29)/B30+B29FORD'S DIVIDENDS EXCLUDING THE 1998 $21.09 DIVIDEND • A better alternative might be to use Ford ’ s total payouts to equity, as illus- trated in this chapter. This method does not mean, however, that we can get away from judgment calls (witness our extensive use of the two-stage Gordon model). • A last alternative to finding Ford ’ s cost of capital is to predict its future dividends by doing a full-blown financial model for the company. Such models—illustrated in the succeeding two chapters—are often used by ana-lysts. Though they are complicated and time consuming to build, they take into account all of the firm ’ s productive and financial activities. Potentially they are, therefore, a more accurate predictor of the dividend. 111 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) Problems with the CAPM In the spreadsheet fragment below you will find the return of the S&P 500 and Big City Bagels.

However, the β of Big City Bagels is –0.0542, which indicates that Big City has—in a portfolio context— negative risk . Were this true, it would mean that adding Big City to a portfolio would lower the portfolio variance enough to justify a below-risk-free return for Big City. While this might be true for some stocks, it is hard to believe that—in the long run—the β of Big City is indeed negative. 20 20. A more plausible explanation is that—for the period covered—Big City ’ s return has nothing whatsoever to do with the market return. 112 Chapter 3 The R 2 of the regression between Big City ’ s returns and the S&P 500 is essentially zero, meaning that the S&P 500 simply doesn ’ t explain any of the variation in Big City returns. For statistics mavens: The t -statistics of the intercept and the slope indicate that neither differs significantly from zero. In short: The regression of Big City Bagels ’ historic returns on the S&P 500 indicates no connection between the two whatsoever. What are we to make of this situation? How should we calculate the cost of capital for Big City? There are several alternatives: • We could assume that the Big City β is –0.0542. The company ’ s tax rate in March 1999 was essentially zero, so that the classical CAPM and the tax- adjusted version coincide: 1 2 3 4 5 6AB C 2 4 5 0 . 0 - a t e b s ' y t i C g i B Risk-free rate, r f 4.29% Expected market return, E(r M) 9.08% Cost of equity, r E 4.03% <-- =B4+B2*(B5-B4)COMPUTING THE COST OF EQUITY r E FOR BIG CITY BAGELS March 1999 • We could assume that the β of Big City is in fact 0; given the standard deviation of the β estimate for Big City, the β is not statistically different from zero, so that this assumption makes sense. This means that all of Big City ’ s risk is diversifiable and that the correct cost of equity for Big City is the risk-less rate of interest. • We could assume that the covariance (or lack thereof) between Big City and the S&P 500 is not indicative of their future correlation. This would eventually lead us to conclude that Big City ’ s risk is comparable to that of similar com-panies. A small study of the β s of snack food companies during the same period shows their β s to be well over 1: New World Coffee has a β of 1.15, Pepsico has a β of 1.42, Starbucks has a β of 1.84. Thus we might conclude that the β of Big City (in the sense of its future correlation with the market) would be somewhere between 1.15 and 1.84. This would, of course, give a radically different cost of equity for Big City: 113 Calculating the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) (For what it ’ s worth: This author would follow the latter case …) 3.17 Summary In this chapter we have illustrated in detail the application of two models for calculating the cost of equity: The Gordon dividend model and the CAPM. We have also considered three of the four practicable models for calculating the cost of debt. Because the application of these models includes for many judgment calls, our advice is to do the following: • Always use several models to calculate the cost of capital. • If you have time, try to calculate the cost of capital not only for the firm you are analyzing but also for other firms in the same industry. • From your analysis try to pick out a consensus estimate of the cost of capital. Don ’ t hesitate to exclude numbers (such as Big City ’ s negative cost of equity) that strike you as unreasonable. In sum, the calculation of the cost of capital is not just a mechanistic exercise! Exercises 1. ABC Corp. has a stock price P 0 = 50. The firm has just paid a dividend of $3 per share, and intelligent shareholders think that this dividend will grow by a rate of 5% per year. Use the Gordon dividend model to calculate the cost of equity of ABC. 2. Unheardof, Inc., has just paid a dividend of $5 per share. This dividend is anticipated to increase at a rate of 15% per year. If the cost of equity for Unheardof is 25%, what should be the market value of a share of the company? 1 2 3 4 5 6AB C 0 0 0 3 . 1 a t e b s ' y t i C g i B Risk-free rate, r f 4.29% Expected market return, E(r M) 9.08% Cost of equity, r E 10.52% <-- =B4+B2*(B5-B4)COMPUTING THE COST OF EQUITY r E FOR BIG CITY BAGELS Assumes that forward-looking beta = 1.3 114 Chapter 3 3. Dismal.Com is a producer of depressing Internet products. The company is currently not paying dividends, but its chief financial officer thinks that starting in 3 years it can pay a dividend of $15 per share, and that this dividend will grow by 20% per year. Assuming that the cost of equity of Dismal.Com is 35%, value a share based on the discounted dividends. 4.

The current stock price of TransContinentalAirways is $65 per share. TCA currently pays an annual per-share dividend of $3. Over the past 5 years this dividend has grown annually at a rate of 23%. A respected analyst assumes that the current growth rate of dividends will hold up for the next 5 years, after which dividend growth will slow to 5% annually. Use the twostagegordon function to compute the cost of equity. 21 6. ABC Corp. has just paid a dividend of $3 per share. You—an experienced analyst—feel quite sure that the growth rate of the company ’ s dividends over the next 10 years will be 15% per year. After 10 years you think that the company ’ s dividend growth rate will slow to the industry average, which is about 5% per year. If the cost of equity for ABC is 12%, what is the value today of one share of the company? 7. Consider a company which has β equity = 1.5 and β debt = 0.4. Suppose that the risk-free rate of interest is 6%, the expected return on the market E ( r M ) = 15%, and that the corporate tax rate is 40%. If the company has 40% equity and 60% debt in its capital structure, calculate its weighted average cost of capital using both the classic CAPM and the tax-adjusted CAPM. 21.

You are considering buying the bonds of a very risky company. A bond with a $100 face value, a 1-year maturity, and a coupon rate of 22% is selling for $95. You consider the probability that the company will actually survive to pay off the bond 80%. With 20% probability, you think that the company will default, in which case you think that you will be able to recover $40. a. What is the expected return on the bond? b. If the company has cost of equity r E = 25%, tax rate T C = 35%, and 40% of its capital structure is equity, what is its weighted average cost of capital (WACC)? 10. It is 1 January 1997.

Calculate NA ’ s β with respect to the S&P 500. b. Suppose that the Treasury bill rate is 5.5% and that the expected return on the market is E ( r M ) = 13%. If the corporate tax rate T C = 35%, calculate NA ’ s cost of equity using both the classic CAPM and tax-adjusted model. c. Assume that NA ’ s cost of debt is 8%. If the company is financed by 1/3 equity and 2/3 debt, what is its weighted average cost of capital using each of the two CAPM models? 11. At the end of June 2007, the price/earnings ratio of the S&P 500 was 17.5. Assume that the index proxies for the market, that it has a 50% dividend payout ratio, and that dividends are expected to grow at 7%. Compute E ( r M ). 12. The template for exercise 12 gives the prices of the Vanguard Index 500 Fund (symbol: VFINX). This fund ’ s prices replicate the S&P 500 with dividends reinvested. Use these data to estimate the expected return on the S&P 500 in two variations: All the data, the last 2 years. (This exercise shows the problematics of using historical market data to estimate the expected returns.) 13. Suppose that the S&P 500 price/earnings ratio is 17.5, the dividend payout ratio of the S&P is 50%, and that you estimate a future growth of dividends of 7%. What is E ( r M )? 14. The template for exercise 14 gives the 10-year history of Intel ’ s quarterly dividends. Compute Intel ’ s cost of equity r E using the Gordon dividend model. Compare the cost of equity computed on the basis of 10 years of growth with that computed on the last 5 years of growth. 4 Valuation Based on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 4.1 Overview Chapter 2 of Financial Modeling defi nes four approaches to corporate valua- tion. All are based on computing the fi rm ’ s enterprise value (EV), defi ned as the present value of the fi rm ’ s future free cash fl ows (FCFs). • The accounting approach to EV moves items on the balance sheet so that all operating items are on the left-hand side of the balance sheet and all fi nan- cial items are on the right-hand side. • The effi cient markets approach to EV revalues—to the extent possible— items on the accounting EV balance sheet at market values. An obvious revalu-ation is to replace the fi rm ’ s book value of equity with the market value of the equity. • The discounted cash fl ow (DCF) approach values the EV as the present value of the fi rm ’ s future anticipated free cash fl ows (FCFs) discounted at the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The FCFs are the cash fl ows pro- duced by the fi rm ’ s productive assets—its working capital, fi xed assets, good- will, etc. In this book we use two implementations of the DCF approach. These approaches differ in their derivation of the fi rm ’ s free cash fl ows: In this chapter we base our projections of future anticipated FCFs on an analysis of the fi rm ’ s consolidated statement of cash fl ows. This method is easy to implement and (for a valuation method, all of which take a lot of time) relatively simple. In Chapters 5 and 6 we base our projections of future anticipated FCFs on a pro forma model for the fi rm ’ s fi nancial statements. Pro forma statements are powerful tools that can be used for business plans as well as valuations, but they are diffi cult and time consuming to implement. Although both Chapter 4 (this chapter) and Chapter 5 differ in their method for deriving the free cash fl ows to be discounted, both chapters boil down to the following template: 118 Chapter 4 The difference between the two DCF approaches is in the derivation of the future FCFs. In this chapter we examine the fi rm ’ s consolidated statement of cash fl ows (CSCFs) and use it as a basis for estimating the future FCFs. We then discuss issues related to estimating the short-term growth rate (8% above), the long-term growth rate (5%), assuming that you have learned from Chapter 3 how to compute the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) (11% above). We focus on a number of important technical issues: • Adjustments that need to be made in the passage from the consolidated statement of cash fl ows (CSCFs) to the free cash fl ow (FCF). These adjust-ments involve: Ⴜ Financing adjustments Ⴜ Corrections for the vagaries of accounting rules Ⴜ Eliminating non-forward-looking items • Dates that don ’ t match. Quite often the dates are not evenly spaced. We may be, for example, projecting from annual statements that end on 31 December, but the current valuation date may be September. How do we make our valu-ation appropriate to this? The answer is to use XNPV , as we shall see. • Estimating the return on assets versus the return on equity. XIRR can provide us with the answer. Finally, we discuss the methodology for making reality fi t our template (or is it vice versa? Sometimes it ’ s hard to tell!). 1 2345 6 789 101112131415 16H G F E D C B A Current free cash flow (FCF) 1,000 Growth rate of FCF, years 1-5 8.00% Long-term FCF growth rate 5.00% Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) 11.00% Year 012345 ) 3 $ B $ + 1 ( * 8 F = - - < 9 6 4 , 1 0 6 3 , 1 0 6 2 , 1 6 6 1 , 1 0 8 0 , 1 s F C F e r u t u F Terminal value 25,713 <-- =G8*(1+B4)/(B5-B4) 9 G + 8 G = - - < 3 8 1 , 7 2 0 6 3 , 1 0 6 2 , 1 6 6 1 , 1 0 8 0 , 1 l a t o T 5 . 0 ^ ) 5 B + 1 ( * ) 0 1 G : 0 1 C , 5 B ( V P N = - - < 3 3 9 , 0 2 e u l a v e s i r p r e t n E t e e h s e c n a l a b t n e r r u c m o r F - - < 0 0 0 , 2 h s a c l a i t i n i k c a b d d A t e e h s e c n a l a b t n e r r u c m o r F - - < 0 0 0 , 0 1 t b e d t u o t c a r t b u S 4 1 B - 3 1 B + 2 1 B = - - < 3 3 9 , 2 1 e u l a v y t i u q E Per share (1,000 shares) 12.93 <-- =B15/1000BASIC CASH FLOW VALUATION TEMPLATE 119 Valuation Based on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 4.2 Free Cash Flow (FCF): Measuring the Cash Produced by the Business The free cash fl ow (FCF) is defi ned as the cash produced by a business without taking into account the way the business is fi nanced—is the best measure of the cash produced by a business. We discussed the defi nition of the FCF in Chapter 2 and here only recall the defi nition: Defi ning the Free Cash Flow Profi t after taxes Accounting measure of fi rm profi tability. It is not a cash fl ow. + Depreciation This noncash expense is added back to the profi t after tax. − Increase in operating current assetsIncrease in sales-related current assets is not an expense for tax purposes (and is therefore ignored in the profi t after taxes), but it is a cash drain on the company.For purposes of FCF, our defi nitions of current assets and current liabilities excludes fi nancing items such as cash and debt. + Increase in operating current liabilitiesIncrease in sale-related current liabilities provides cash to the fi rm. − Increase in fi xed assets at costAn increase in fi xed assets (the long-term productive assets of the company) is a use of cash, which reduces the fi rm ’ s free cash fl ow. + After-tax net interest paymentsFCF measures the cash produced by the business activity of the fi rm. Add back after-tax net interest payments to neutralize the interest component of the profi t after taxes. In this chapter we base our computations of the free cash fl ow (FCF) on the fi rm ’ s consolidated statement of cash fl ows (CSCFs).

We also adjust the fi gures by adding back after-tax net interest. Since we want to use the CSCF to produce forward-looking FCFs, we may also want to eliminate operating 122 Chapter 4 or investment items that are not expected to recur. 1 In most cases these adjust- ments amount to the following: • Accept all operating activities in the CSCF. • Dispense with all fi nancing activities. • Carefully examine the investing activities, eliminating those that are fi nan- cial but keeping the operational items. • Add back after-tax interest.

The current example has no such items. 1 2 34 5 6 7 89 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 2021 22 23 24 25 26 272829 30 31323334353637G F E D C B A 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Operating Activities: Net earnings 479,355 495,597 534,268 505,856 520,273 Adjustments to reconcile net earnings to net cash provided by operating activities Add back depreciation and amortization 41,583 47,647 46,438 45,839 46,622 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Subtract increase in accounts receivable 9,387 25,951 -12,724 1,685 -2,153 Subtract increase in inventories -37,630 -22,780 -16,247 -15,780 -5,517 Subtract increase in prepaid expenses and other assets-52,191 13,573 16,255 14,703 -2,975 Add increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, pensions, and other liabilities29,612 51,172 6,757 40,541 60,255 Net cash provided by operating activities 470,116 611,160 574,747 592,844 616,505 <-- =SUM(F4:F11) Investing Activities: Short-term investments, net Purchases of property, plant and equipment -48,944 -70,326 -89,947 -37,044 -88,426 Proceeds from dispositions of property, plant and equipment197 6,956 22,942 6,179 28,693 Net cash used in investing activities -53,747 -118,370 -67,005 -30,865 -59,733 <-- =SUM(F15:F17) Financing Activities:Repayment of debtProceeds from revolving credit facility borrowings Proceeds from the issuance of stock Dividends paid Stock repurchasedNet cash used in financing activities Free cash flow before interest adjustment 416,369 492,790 507,742 561,979 556,772 <-- =F12+F18+F26 Add back after-tax net interest 54,537 61,658 44,271 36,620 36,504 <-- =(1-F37)*F35 Free cash flow (FCF) 470,906 554,448 552,013 598,599 593,276 <-- =F28+F29 Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information Cash paid during the period for Income taxes 255,043 175,972 314,735 283,618 305,094 Interest 83,553 83,551 70,351 57,151 57,910 Income tax rate 34.73% 26.20% 37.07% 35.92% 36.96% <-- =F34/(F4+F34)ABC CORPORATION Consolidated Statement of Ca sh Flows, 2008-2012 123 Valuation Based on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows The Enterprise Value and the Value per Share At this point we have estimates for the fi rm ’ s historical FCFs. In order to apply the methodology, we need to estimate three parameters: • The short-term growth rate of ABC cash fl ows. • The long-term growth rate of ABC cash fl ows. • The weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Some analysis, combined with seat-of-the-pants intuition, leads to the fol- lowing parameter choices and valuation.

The reason is that, as shown above, the terminal value formula is valid only if the long-term growth rate is less than the WACC. In the following sections we deal with a number of issues that arise in this valuation process. 124 Chapter 4 4.4 Merck: Reverse Engineering the Market Value The method discussed in this chapter can often be used to extract market expectations of growth. As an example, consider Merck. Manipulation of the CSCF produces a 2011 FCF of $10,346 million. Using the WACC of 5.66% computed in Chapter 3 and some arbitrary values for the short- and long-term FCF growth rates gives us the valuation template for Merck below. 2 2.

If the short-term growth rate is 6% and the long-term growth is 3%, then our model produces a share value of $154.43, which is very much larger than Merck ’ s stock price of $37.70. We use a Data Table to fi nd what current market price represents in terms of long-term growth and WACC: 125 Valuation Based on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows We have used Excel ’ s Conditional Formatting to highlight Merck share valuations that are + / − 20% of the current market price. It is now clear that the market imputes a negative long-term growth rate to Merck ’ s free cash fl ows. We can also do some sensitivity analysis on the short-term growth rate (perhaps it doesn ’ t make sense that Merck ’ s long-term growth is so low and that its short-term growth is 6%). Changing the short-term growth to 3% pro-duces the following Data Table : 20 212223 24 2526 27 282930 31 3233 34 35G F E D C B A Data table: Model share price as function of LT growth and WACC, short-term FCF growth rate = 6% Long-term growth rate ¼ =IF(B5>B4,B17,\"nmf\") --> 154.43 -5% -4% -3% -2% 0% 5.0% 51.83 56.09 61.42 68.28 90.21 5.2% 50.77 54.83 59.89 66.35 86.715.4% 49.76 53.63 58.43 64.52 83.48 WACC --> 5.6% 48.78 52.48 57.03 62.79 80.47 5.8% 47.84 51.37 55.70 61.15 77.676.0% 46.93 50.31 54.43 59.59 75.066.2% 46.06 49.29 53.22 58.11 72.62 6.4% 45.22 48.31 52.05 56.70 70.33 6.6% 44.40 47.36 50.94 55.35 68.18 6.8% 43.62 46.45 49.87 54.07 66.15 7.0% 42.86 45.58 48.85 52.84 64.25 7.2% 42.12 44.74 47.86 51.67 62.44 7.4% 41.41 43.92 46.91 50.54 60.74 20 212223 24 2526 27 282930 31 3233 34 35G F E D C B A Data table: Model share price as function of LT growth and WACC, short-term FCF growth rate = 3% Long-term growth rate ¼ =IF(B5>B4,B17,\"nmf\") --> 134.59 -5% -4% -3% -2% 0% 5.0% 45.71 49.40 54.02 59.96 78.96 5.2% 44.79 48.31 52.69 58.28 75.93 5.4% 43.91 47.26 51.42 56.70 73.12 WACC --> 5.6% 43.06 46.26 50.21 55.20 70.51 5.8% 42.24 45.30 49.05 53.77 68.09 6.0% 41.45 44.38 47.95 52.42 65.82 6.2% 40.69 43.49 46.90 51.13 63.70 6.4% 39.96 42.64 45.89 49.91 61.72 6.6% 39.25 41.82 44.92 48.74 59.85 6.8% 38.57 41.03 43.99 47.62 58.10 7.0% 37.91 40.27 43.10 46.56 56.44 7.2% 37.27 39.54 42.24 45.54 54.88 7.4% 36.66 38.83 41.42 44.56 53.40 The conclusion remains the same: Market expectations of Merck ’ s long- term growth prospects appear to be negative. 126 Chapter 4 4.5 Summary This chapter has illustrated a relatively corporate simple valuation technique. Starting with free cash fl ows derived from the consolidated statement of cash fl ows, we build a simple valuation template that is a function of only four parameters: the current FCF, the short-term FCF growth rate, the long-term FCF growth rate, and the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Our tech-nique allows us to focus on the main valuation parameters and also allows us to reverse engineer the growth and WACC expectations built into the current market price.

Use this information and the template of section 4.1 to value Kellogg. 5 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling 5.1 Overview The usefulness of fi nancial statement projections for corporate fi nancial man- agement is undisputed. Such projections, termed pro forma fi nancial state- ments , are the bread and butter for much corporate fi nancial analysis. In this and the next chapter we will focus on the use of pro formas for valuing the fi rm and its component securities, but pro formas also form the basis for many credit analyses; by examining pro forma fi nancial statements we can predict how much fi nancing a fi rm will need in future years. We can play the usual “what if ” games of simulation models, and we can use pro formas to ask what strains on the fi rm may be caused by changes in fi nancial and sales parameters. In this chapter we present a variety of fi nancial models. All the models are sales driven, in that they assume that many of the balance sheet and income statement items are directly or indirectly related to sales. The mathematical structure of solving the models involves fi nding the solution to a set of simul-taneous linear equations predicting both the balance sheets and the income statements for the coming years. However, the user of a spreadsheet need never worry about the solution of the model; the fact that spreadsheets can solve—by iteration—the fi nancial relations of the model means that we only have to worry about correctly stating the relevant accounting relations in our Excel model. 5.2 How Financial Models Work: Theory and an Initial Example Almost all fi nancial statement models are sales driven ; this term means that as many as possible of the most important fi nancial statement variables are assumed to be functions of the sales level of the fi rm. For example, accounts receivable are often taken as a direct percentage of the sales of the fi rm. A slightly more complicated example might postulate that the fi xed assets (or some other account) are a step function of the level of sales: Fixed assetsa if sales A b if A sales B etc=< ≤<⎧ ⎨⎪ ⎩⎪. 128 Chapter 5 To solve a fi nancial planning model, we must distinguish between those fi nancial statement items that are functional relationships of sales and perhaps of other fi nancial statement items and those items that involve policy decisions. The asset side of the balance sheet is usually assumed to be dependent only on functional relationships. The current liabilities may also be taken to involve functional relationships only, leaving the mix between long-term debt and equity as a policy decision. A simple example is the following. We wish to predict the fi nancial state- ments for a fi rm whose current balance sheet and income statement are as follows: 13 1415 16 171819202122 23 242526272829 30 313233343536 37 3839B A 0 r a e Y Income statement 0 0 0 , 1 s e l a S ) 0 0 5 ( d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C ) 2 3 ( t b e d n o s t n e m y a p t s e r e t n I Interest earned on cash and marketable securities 6 ) 0 0 1 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D 4 7 3 x a t e r o f e b t i f o r P ) 0 5 1 ( s e x a T 5 2 2 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P ) 0 9 ( s d n e d i v i D 5 3 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e R Balance sheet 0 8 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a C 0 5 1 s t e s s a t n e r r u C Fixed assets 0 7 0 , 1 t s o c t A ) 0 0 3 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D 0 7 7 s t e s s a d e x i f t e N Total assets 1,000 0 8 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C 0 2 3 t b e D 0 5 4 k c o t S 0 5 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e r d e t a l u m u c c A Total liabilities and equity 1,000 129 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling The current (year 0) level of sales is 1,000. The fi rm expects its sales to grow at a rate of 10% per year, and it anticipates the following fi nancial state- ment relations: Current assets: Assumed to be 15% of end-of-year sales Current liabilities: Assumed to be 8% of end-of-year salesNet fi xed assets: 77% of end-of-year salesDepreciation: 10% of the average value of assets on the books during the year. Fixed assets at cost: Sum of net fi xed assets plus accumulated depreciation. Debt: The fi rm neither repays any existing debt nor borrows any more money over the 5-year horizon of the pro formas. Cash and marketable securities:This is the balance sheet plug (see explanation below). Average balances of cash and marketable securities are assumed to earn 8% interest. The “Plug” Perhaps the most important fi nancial policy variable in the fi nancial statement modeling is the “plug”: This relates to the decision as to which balance sheet item will “close” the model: • How do we guarantee that assets and liabilities are equal (this is “closure” in the accounting sense)? • How does the fi rm fi nance its incremental investments (this is “fi nancial closure”)? In general the plug in a pro forma model will be one of three fi nancial balance sheet items: (i) Cash and marketable securities, (ii) debt, or (iii) stock. 1 As an example, consider the balance sheet of our fi rst pro forma model: 1. As noted in Chapter 3, cash can often be considered negative debt and vice versa. We return to this point in section 5.5. 130 Chapter 5 Assets Liabilities and Equity Cash and marketable securities Current liabilities Current assets Debt Fixed assets Fixed assets at cost – Accumulated depreciation Net fi xed assets Equity Stock (net funds directly provided by shareholders) Accumulated retained earnings (profi ts not paid out) Total assets Total liabilities and equity In the current example we assume that cash and marketable securities will be the plug. This assumption has two meanings: 1. The mechanical meaning of the plug: Formally, we defi ne Cash and marketable securities = Total liabilities and equity – Current assets – Net fi xed assets By using this defi nition, we guarantee that assets and liabilities will always be equal. 2. The fi nancial meaning of the plug: By defi ning the plug to be cash and marketable securities, we are also making a statement about how the fi rm fi nances itself. In our model below, for example, the fi rm sells no additional stock, does not pay back any of its existing debt, and does not raise any more debt. This defi nition means that all incremental fi nancing (if needed) for the fi rm will come from the cash and marketable securities account; it also means that if the fi rm has additional cash, it will go into this account. Projecting Next Year ’ s Balance Sheet and Income Statement Above we have given the fi nancial statement for year 0. We now project the fi nancial statement for year 1: 131 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling The formulas are mostly obvious. (The dollar signs—indicating that when the formulas are copied the cell references to the model parameters should not change—are very important! If you fail to put them in the model will not copy correctly when you project years 2 and beyond.)

Most companies also book an expense item called Selling, General, and Administrative expenses (SG&A). The change you would have to make to accommodate this item are obvious (see an exercise at the end of this chapter). • Interest payments on debt = Interest rate on debt * Average debt over the year This formula allows us to accommodate changes in the model for repay- ment of debt, and rollover of debt at different interest rates. Note that in the current version of the model, debt stays constant, but in other versions of the model discussed below debt will vary over time. • Interest earned on cash and marketable securities = Interest rate on cash * Average cash and marketable securities over the year • Depreciation = Depreciation rate * Average fi xed assets at cost over the year This calculation assumes that all new fi xed assets are purchased during the year. We also assume that there is no disposal of fi xed assets. • Profi t before taxes = Sales – Costs of goods sold – Interest payments on debt + Interest earned on cash and marketable securities – Depreciation • T a x e s = Tax rate * Profi t before taxes • Profi t after taxes = Profi t before taxes – Taxes • Dividends = Dividend payout ratio * Profi t after taxes. The fi rm is assumed to pay out a fi xed percentage of its profi ts as dividends. An alternative would be to assume that the fi rm has a target for its dividends per share. • Retained earnings = Profi t after taxes – Dividends 133 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling Balance Sheet Equations • Cash and marketable securities = Total liabilities and equity – Current assets – Net fi xed assets As explained above, this means that cash and marketable securities are the balance sheet plug. • Current assets = Current assets/Sales * Sales • Net fi xed assets = Net fi xed assets/Sales * Sales 2 • Accumulated depreciation = Previous year ’ s accumulated depreciation + Depreciation rate * Average fi xed assets at cost over the year • Fixed assets at cost = Net fi xed assets + Accumulated depreciation Note that this model does not distinguish between plant property and equip- ment (PP&E) and other fi xed assets such as land. • Current liabilities = Current liabilities/Sales * Sales • Debt is assumed to be unchanged. An alternative model, which we will explore later, assumes that debt is the balance sheet plug. • Stock doesn ’ t change. (Shareholders provide no additional direct fi nancing: the company is assumed to issue no new stock or repurchase any stock.) • Accumulated retained earnings = Previous year ’ s accumulated retained earn- ings + Current year ’ s additions to retained earnings 2. This is not the only way to model fi xed assets. An alternative method assumes that net fi xed assets are constant; see section 5.6 for an implementation. 134 Chapter 5 Circular References in Excel Financial statement models in Excel almost always involve cells that are mutually dependent. As a result the solution of the model depends on the ability of Excel to solve circular references. If you open a spreadsheet that involves iteration and if your spreadsheet is not set up for circular references you will see the following Excel error message: To make sure your spreadsheet recalculates, you have to go to the File|Options|Formulas box and click Enable iterative calculation : Extending the Model to Years 2 and Beyond Now that you have the model set up, you can extend it by copying the columns: 135 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling Note that the most common mistake to make in the transition between the two-columned fi nancial model and this one is the failure to mark the model parameters with dollar signs. If you commit this error, you will get zeros in places where there should be numbers. 1 2 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 192021 22 23 24 25 2627 28 2930 31 3233 34 3536 37 3839G F E D C B A % 0 1 h t w o r g s e l a S % 5 1 s e l a S / s t e s s a t n e r r u C % 8 s e l a S / s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C % 7 7 s e l a S / s t e s s a d e x i f t e N % 0 5 s e l a S / d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C % 0 1 e t a r n o i t a i c e r p e D Interest rate %0 0 . 0 1 t b e d n o Interest paid on cash and marketable securities 8.00% % 0 4 e t a r x a T % 0 4 o i t a r t u o y a p d n e d i v i D 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y Income statement 0 0 0 , 1 s e l aS 1,100 1,210 1,331 1,464 1,611 ) 0 0 5 ( d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C (550) (605) (666) (732) (805) ) 2 3 ( t b e d n o s t n e m y a p t s e r e t n I (32) (32) (32) (32) (32) Interest earned on cash and marketable securities 6 9 14 20 26 33 ) 0 0 1 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D (117) (137) (161) (189) (220) 4 7 3 x a t e r o f e b t i f o r P 410 450 492 538 587 ) 0 5 1 ( s e x a T (164) (180) (197) (215) (235) 5 2 2 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 246 270 295 323 352 ) 0 9 ( s d n e d i v i D (98) (108) (118) (129) (141) 5 3 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e R 148 162 177 194 211 Balance sheet 0 8 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a C 144 213 289 371 459 0 5 1 s t e s s a t n e r r u C 165 182 200 220 242 Fixed assets 0 7 0 , 1 t s o c t A 1,264 1,486 1,740 2,031 2,364 ) 0 0 3 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D (417) (554) (715) (904) (1,124) 0 7 7 s t e s s a d e x i f t e N 847 932 1,025 1,127 1,240 Total assets 1,000 1,156 1,326 1,513 1,718 1,941 0 8 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C 88 97 106 117 129 0 2 3 t b eD 320 320 320 320 320 0 5 4 k c o tS 450 450 450 450 450 0 5 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e r d e t a l u m u c c A 298 460 637 830 1,042 Total liabilities and equity 1,000 1,156 1,326 1,513 1,718 1,941 FIRST FINANCIAL MODEL 136 Chapter 5 5.3 Free Cash Flow (FCF): Measuring the Cash Produced by the Business Now that we have the model, we can use it to make fi nancial predictions. The most important calculation for valuation purposes is the free cash fl ow (FCF). FCF—the cash produced by a business without taking into account the way the business is fi nanced—is the best measure of the cash produced by a busi-ness. An extended discussion of the FCF was included in Chapter 2. For refer-ence, we briefl y repeat the defi nition given in that chapter: Defi ning the Free Cash Flow Profi t after taxes Accounting measure of fi rm profi tability. It is not a cash fl ow. + Depreciation This noncash expense is added back to the profi t after tax. − Increase in operating current assetsIncrease in sales-related current assets is not an expense for tax purposes (and is therefore ignored in the profi t after taxes), but it is a cash drain on the company.For purposes of FCF, our defi nitions of current assets and current liabilities excludes fi nancing items such as cash and debt. + Increase in operating current liabilitiesIncrease in sale-related current liabilities provides cash to the fi rm. − Increase in fi xed assets at costAn increase in fi xed assets (the long-term productive assets of the company) is a use of cash, which reduces the fi rm ’ s free cash fl ow. + After-tax net interest paymentsFCF measures the cash produced by the business activity of the fi rm. Add back after-tax net interest payments to neutralize the interest component of the profi t after taxes. 137 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling Here is the calculation for our fi rm: 40 41 42 43 44 4546 47 48 49 50G F E D C B A 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y Free cash flow calculation 2 5 3 3 2 3 5 9 2 0 7 2 6 4 2 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 0 2 2 9 8 1 1 6 1 7 3 1 7 1 1 n o i t a i c e r p e d k c a b d d A ) 2 2 ( ) 0 2 ( ) 8 1 ( ) 7 1 ( ) 5 1 ( s t e s s a t n e r r u c n i e s a e r c n i t c a r t b u S 2 1 1 1 0 1 9 8 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u c n i e s a e r c n i k c a b d d A ) 3 3 3 ( ) 1 9 2 ( ) 4 5 2 ( ) 2 2 2 ( ) 4 9 1 ( t s o c t a s t e s s a d e x i f n i e s a e r c n i t c a r t b u S 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 t b e d n o t s e r e t n i x a t - r e t f a k c a b d d A Subtract after-tax interest on cash and mkt. securities (5) (9) (12) (16) (20) Free cash flow 176 188 201 214 228 53 54 55 56 5758 59 60 61 62 63 6465 66 67 68 69 70 7172 73 74 75H G F E D C B A Cash flow from operating activities 6 4 2 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 270 295 323 352 <-- =G22 7 1 1 n o i t a i c e r p e d k c a b d d A 137 161 189 220 <-- =-G19 Adjust for changes in net working capital: ) 5 1 ( s t e s s a t n e r r u c n i e s a e r c n i t c a r t b u S (17) (18) (20) (22) <-- =-(G28-F28) 8 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u c n i e s a e r c n i k c a b d d A 9 10 11 12 <-- =G35-F35 6 5 3 s e i t i v i t c a g n i t a r e p o m o r f h s a c t e N 400 448 502 562 <-- =SUM(G55:G59) Cash flow from investing activities ) 4 9 1 ( s e r u t i d n e p x e l a t i p a c - - s t e s s a d e x i f f o s n o i t i s i u q A (222) (254) (291) (333) <-- =-(G30-F30) l e d o m r u o n i t o N - - < 0 0 0 0 0 s e i t i r u c e s t n e m t s e v n i f o s e s a h c r u P l e d o m r u o n i t o N - - < 0 0 0 0 0 s e i t i r u c e s t n e m t s e v n i f o s e l a s m o r f s d e e c o r P ) 4 9 1 ( s e i t i v i t c a g n i t s e v n i n i d e s u h s a c t e N (222) (254) (291) (333) <-- =SUM(G63:G65) Cash flow from financing activities 6 3 F - 6 3 G = - - < 0 0 0 0 0 s e i t i v i t c a g n i w o r r o b m o r f s d e e c o r p t e N 7 3 F - 7 3 G = - - < 0 0 0 0 0 s e s a h c r u p e r , s e u s s i k c o t s m o r f s d e e c o r p t e N ) 8 9 ( d i a p s d n e d i v i D (108) (118) (129) (141) <-- =G23 ) 1 7 G : 9 6 G ( M U S = - - < ) 1 4 1 ( ) 9 2 1 ( ) 8 1 1 ( ) 8 0 1 ( ) 8 9 ( s e i t i v i t c a g n i c n a n i f m o r f h s a c t e N 0 6 G + 6 6 G + 2 7 G = - - < 8 8 2 8 6 7 0 7 4 6 s t n e l a v i u q e h s a c d n a h s a c n i e s a e r c n i t e N 4 6 s e i t i r u c e s . t k m d n a h s a c n i s e g n a h c : k c e h C 70 76 82 88 <-- =G27-F27CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS: RECONCILING THE CASH BALANCES Reconciling the Cash Balances The free cash fl ow calculation is different from the “consolidated statement of cash fl ows” that is a part of every accounting statement. The purpose of the consolidated statement of cash fl ows is to explain the increase in the cash accounts in the balance sheet as a function of the cash fl ows from the fi rm ’ s operating, investing, and fi nancing activities. In the pro forma example of this section we treat the cash and marketable securities as the balance sheet plug; however, it can also be derived from a standard accounting statement of cash fl ows: 138 Chapter 5 Line 75 checks that the changes in the cash accounts derived through the consolidated statement of cash fl ows match those derived in the fi nancial model (which uses cash as a plug). As you can see, the model works, in the sense that changes in cash balances from the consolidated statement of cash fl ows in fact match those in the projected balance sheets of the pro forma model. 5.4 Using the Free Cash Flow (FCF) to Value the Firm and Its Equity The enterprise value of the fi rm is the present value of the fi rm ’ s future antici- pated free cash fl ows. We can use the pro forma FCF projections and a cost of capital to determine the enterprise value of the fi rm. Suppose we have deter- mined that the fi rm ’ s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 20% (recall that the calculation of the WACC was discussed in Chapter 2). Then the enter- prise value of the fi rm is the discounted value of the fi rm ’ s projected FCFs plus its terminal value: Enterprise valueFCF WACCt t= +()=∞ ∑1 11 Most fi nancial analysts consider it presumptuous to project an infi nite number of free cash fl ows; therefore the projected cash fl ow stream is often cut off at some arbitrary date and a terminal value is substituted for the cash fl ows beyond this date: Enterprise valueFCF WACCFCF WACCFCF WACC= +()+ +()++ +()1 12 25 11 1…5 5 55 1+ +()Year Terminal Value WACC- In this formula, the Year-5 Terminal Value is a proxy for the present value of all FCFs from year 6 onward. Instead of projecting the FCFs from year 6 139 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling onward, we use the most common terminal value model, assuming that year-5 free cash fl ows grow at a long-term growth rate LTg : Terminal Value at end of yearFCF WACCFCF LTg t t t5 11 5 15= +()=∗+( + =∞ ∑) ) +() =∗+() − <=∞ ∑t t t WACC FCF LTg WACC LTg LTg WACC1 11 5 provided This model (based on the formula for the present value of a growing annuity, see section 1.1) assumes that the year-5 cash fl ow will continue to grow at a constant long-term growth rate. Note that the formula is senseless if the long-term growth rate LTg is greater than or equal to the weighted average cost of capital; if this were the case, then the terminal value would be infi nite (clearly impossible).

The sales growth is the anticipated growth over the years 1–5; the long-term growth rate is prob-ably better estimated by making a more realistic estimate of the growth of the 140 Chapter 5 fi rm ’ s market sector. For fi rms operating in a mature market, we often estimate the long-term FCF growth as the sum of real growth plus anticipated infl ation. 5.5 Some Notes on the Valuation Procedure In this section we cover some issues related to the valuation procedure outlined in section 5.4. Terminal Value In determining the terminal value we used a version of the growing annuity model described in Chapter 1. We have assumed that—after the year-5 projec-tion horizon—the cash fl ows will grow at a long-term rate of growth of 5%. This gives the terminal value as: Terminal Value at end of yearFCF Long term FCF growth WACC51 5=∗+() −- LLong term FCF growth - As noted in the previous section, this formula is only valid if the long-term FCF growth is less than the WACC. There are other ways of calculating the terminal value. All of the following are common variations that can be implemented in the framework of our model (see end-of-chapter exercises): • Terminal value = Year-5 book value of debt + Equity This calculation assumes that the book value correctly predicts the market value. • Terminal value = (Enterprise market/book multiple) * (Year-5 book value of debt + Equity) • Terminal value = P/E ratio * Year-5 profi ts + Year-5 book value of debt • Terminal value = EBITDA ratio * Year-5 anticipated EBITDA (EBITDA = Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.) The Treatment of Cash and Marketable Securities in the Valuation We have added the initial cash balances back to the present value of the projected FCFs to get the enterprise value. This procedure assumes the following: 141 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling • Year-0 balances of cash and marketable securities are not needed to produce the FCFs in subsequent years. • Year-0 balances of cash and marketable securities are “surpluses” which could be drawn down or paid out by shareholders without affecting the future economic performance of the fi rm. A wholly equivalent assumption sometimes made by investment bankers and equity analysts is to assume that initial cash balances are negative debt . If you made this assumption, you would value the equity in the following way: 68 69 7071D C B A Cash and marketable securities as negative debt 2 6 B = - - < 5 9 2 , 1 e u l a v e s i r p r e t n e = 0 6 w o r f o V P N 7 2 B + 6 3 B - = - - < ) 0 4 2 ( h s a c s u n i m t b e d : t b e d 0 r a e y t e N 0 7 B + 9 6 B = - - < 5 5 0 , 1 e u l a v y t i u q E Mid-Year Discounting While the NPV formula assumes that all cash fl ows occur at the end of the year, it is more logical to assume that they occur smoothly throughout the year. For discounting purposes, we should therefore discount cash fl ows as if, on average, they occur in the middle of the year. This means that the enterprise value is more logically calculated as: Enterprise valueFCF WACCFCF WACC FCF WA= +()+ +()+ + +1 052 15 511 1..… CCCYear Terminal Value WACC FCF WACCFCF()+ +() =+()+45 4 5 1 15 1 1.. .- 2 2 2 5 551 15 1+()+ + +()+ +()⎡ ⎣WACC FCF WACCYear Terminal Value WACC… -⎢ ⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥ ↑ This can be calculated using Excel’s NPV functi ion/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext ∗+()105WACC. Incorporating this mid-year discounting into our value calculations gives: 142 Chapter 5 5.6 Alternative Modeling of Fixed Assets The models in this chapter assume that the net fi xed assets (NFA) are a func- tion of sales. In effect this means that we assume that the depreciation of the fi xed assets has actual economic meaning, so that the productive capacity of these assets is determined by their after-depreciation value. At the ethereal level of the pro forma models of this chapter, this appears to us to be an accept-able assumption. There are, however, two alternative models that the fi nancial modeler may want to consider. The fi rst of these assumes that depreciation has no economic meaning. In this case the gross fi xed assets are a function of sales. The second alternative model is to assume that the existing fi xed asset base, if properly maintained, can accommodate reasonable levels of future sales. 3 Both alterna- tive models are easily accommodated in the pro forma framework already set out; in the remainder of this section we give illustrations. Gross Fixed Assets Are a Function of Sales Suppose depreciation has no economic meaning, so that the fi xed assets at cost represent the future productive capacity of assets. 4 This requires only a small adjustment to our previous model: 3. A third alternative is to extensively model future fi xed asset expenditures. While this may add the whiff of “reality” to the fi nancial model, it often just adds many layers of fi nancial and model-ing confusion. 4. Depreciation will of course continue to have a cash fl ow meaning, reducing taxable income. 74 75 76777879808182 83 84858687J I H G F E D C B A Valuing the firm—using mid-year discounting % 0 2 l a t i p a c f o t s o c e g a r e v a d e t h g i e W % 5 e t a r h t w o r g w o l f h s a c e e r f m r e t - g n o L Year 012345 8 2 2 4 1 2 1 0 2 8 8 1 6 7 1 F C F Terminal value 1,598 <-- =G79*(1+B76)/(B75-B76) 6 2 8 , 1 4 1 2 1 0 2 8 8 1 6 7 1 l a t o T 5 . 0 ^ ) 5 7 B + 1 ( * ) 1 8 G : 1 8 C , 5 7 B ( V P N = - - < 8 4 3 , 1 1 8 w o r f o V P N , e u l a v e s i r p r e t n E Add in initial (year 0) cash and mkt. securities 80 <-- =B27 3 8 B + 4 8 B = - - < 8 2 4 , 1 0 r a e y n i e u l a v t e s s A 5 6 B = - - < ) 0 2 3 ( y a d o t t b e d s ' m r i f f o e u l a v t u o t c a r t b u S 6 8 B + 5 8 B = - - < 8 0 1 , 1 e u l a v y t i u q E 143 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling Net Fixed Assets Are Constant In certain cases it may be appropriate to assume that the current fi xed assets, if properly maintained, can accommodate reasonable levels of future sales. An example might be the case of a supermarket—if depreciation is taken to be the economic expression of the maintenance and asset replacement required to service the existing customer base, then this means that the net fi xed assets would be constant over time. This assumption has been made in a number of Harvard cases. 5 This variation in our basic model is easily made, as shown below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 26 27 28 29 303132 33H G F E D C B A % 0 1 h t w o r g s e l a S % 5 1 s e l a S / s t e s s a t n e r r u C % 8 s e l a S / s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C % 7 0 1 s e l a S / t s o c t a s t e s s a d e x i F % 0 5 s e l a S / d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C % 0 1 e t a r n o i t a i c e r p e D % 0 0 . 0 1 t b e d n o e t a r t s e r e t n I Interest paid on cash and marketable securities 8.00% % 0 4 e t a r x a T % 0 4 o i t a r t u o y a p d n e d i v i D Balance sheet 0 8 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a C 2 29 398 589 805 1,049 0 5 1 s t e s s a t n e r r u C 165 182 200 220 242 Fixed assets 0 7 0 , 1 t s o c t A 1,177 1,295 1,424 1,567 1,723 <-- =$B$5*G15 ) 0 0 3 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D (412) (536) (672) (821) (986) <-- =F31+G19 0 7 7 s t e s s a d e x i f t e N 765 759 752 745 737 <-- =G30+G31 Total assets 1,000 1,158 1,338 1,541 1,770 2,028 FIXED ASSETS AT COST IS A FUNCTION OF SALES 12 345 6 789 1011 26 27 28 29 3031 32 33H G F E D C B A % 0 1 h t w o r g s e l a S % 5 1 s e l a S / s t e s s a t n e r r u C % 8 s e l a S / s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C t n a t s n o C s t e s s a d e x i f t e N % 0 5 s e l a S / d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C % 0 1 e t a r n o i t a i c e r p e D % 0 0 . 0 1 t b e d n o e t a r t s e r e t n I Interest paid on cash and marketable securities 8.00% % 0 4 e t a r x a T % 0 4 o i t a r t u o y a p d n e d i v i D Balance sheet 0 8 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a C 223 386 570 777 1,010 0 5 1 s t e s s a t n e r r u C 165 182 200 220 242 Fixed assets 0 7 0 , 1 t s o c t A 1,183 1,307 1,445 1,597 1,765 <-- =G32-G31 ) 0 0 3 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D (413) (537) (675) (827) (995) <-- =F31+G19 0 7 7 s t e s s a d e x i f t e N 770 770 770 770 770 <-- =F32 Total assets 1,000 1,158 1,337 1,539 1,767 2,022 NET FIXED ASSETS CONSTANT Depreciation reinvested into fixed assets 5.

Taking the example in section 5.3 as our base case, we can ask, for example, what is the effect of the sales growth rate on the equity value of the fi rm: 41 424344 45 46474849 50H G F E D C B A Year 012345 Free cash flow calculation 6 0 4 1 6 3 0 2 3 4 8 2 1 5 2 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 9 1 G - = - - < 8 6 1 2 5 1 8 3 1 4 2 1 3 1 1 n o i t a i c e r p e d k c a b d d A ) 2 2 ( ) 0 2 ( ) 8 1 ( ) 7 1 ( ) 5 1 ( s t e s s a t n e r r u c n i e s a e r c n i t c a r t b u S 2 1 1 1 0 1 9 8 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u c n i e s a e r c n i k c a b d d A ) 0 3 F - 0 3 G ( - = - - < ) 8 6 1 ( ) 2 5 1 ( ) 8 3 1 ( ) 4 2 1 ( ) 3 1 1 ( t s o c t a s t e s s a d e x i f n i e s a e r c n i t c a r t b u S 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 t b e d n o t s e r e t n i x a t - r e t f a k c a b d d A Subtract after-tax interest on cash and mkt. securities (7) (15) (23) (32) (43) Free cash flow 2 5 52 8 13 0 83 3 93 7 2 Cells B91:C100 contain a data table (see Chapter 31 if you are unsure of how to construct these tables). While initial increases in sales growth increase the value of the fi rm, very high sales growth actually decreases fi rm value. We leave it to you to check that this is due to the high fi xed assets to sales ratio. 145 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling Another variation is to calculate the effect on equity valuation of both the long-term FCF growth and the WACC. Here, however, you have to be careful: Examining the terminal value equation Terminal ValueFCF long term FCF growth WACC long term FCF=∗+() −51- - ggrowth will show you that this calculation only makes sense if the WACC is greater than the growth rate. 6 To overcome this problem we defi ne the data table cell B107 (this is the calculation on which the data table does its sensitivity analysis) in the following way: 6. If the growth rate > WACC, then Terminal ValueFCF long term FCF growth WACCt t t=∗+() +()=∞ =∞ ∑5 11 1- . Thus the WACC puts an effective bound on the long-term growth rate. 107 108109110111112113114 115 116117K J I H G F E D C B A WACC 1,108.37 10% 12% 14% 16% 18% 20% 22% 24% 26% 0% 2,038.12 1,660.04 1,390.52 1,188.82 1,032.29 907.35 805.37 720.58 649.00 Growth rate of sales --> 2% 2,447.00 1,915.96 1,562.34 1,310.08 1,121.12 974.36 857.11 761.31 681.59 4% 3,128.45 2,299.84 1,802.89 1,471.75 1,235.34 1,058.12 920.35 810.19 720.10 6% 4,491.36 2,939.65 2,163.72 1,698.09 1,387.62 1,165.81 999.40 869.93 766.32 8% 8,580.08 4,219.26 2,765.09 2,037.61 1,600.82 1,309.39 1,101.03 944.61 822.81 10% nmf 8,058.09 3,967.84 2,603.47 1,920.62 1,510.41 1,236.55 1,040.62 893.42 12% nmf nmf 7,576.07 3,735.18 2,453.61 1,811.94 1,426.27 1,168.64 984.20 14% nmf nmf nmf 7,130.34 3,519.60 2,314.48 1,710.85 1,347.86 1,105.25 16% nmf nmf nmf nmf 6,717.58 3,319.58 2,185.15 1,616.70 1,274.71=IF(B75<=B76,\"nmf\",B87)↓ 5.8 Debt as a Plug In the model shown above, cash and marketable securities were the plug and debt was a constant. However, for some values of the model parameters, you can get negative cash and marketable securities. Consider the following example—this is still the same model as above, but—as indicated on the spreadsheet itself—with some different parameter values: 146 Chapter 5 Given these changes the cash and marketable securities account (row 27 in the above example) turns negative by year 2, a result which is obviously illogi- cal. However, the economic meaning of these negative numbers is clear: Given the increased sales growth, increased current asset and fi xed asset require-ments, and increased dividend payouts, the fi rm needs more fi nancing. 7 What we want is a model which recognizes that: • Cash cannot be less than zero. • When the fi rm needs additional fi nancing, it borrows money. 1 2 3 4567 8 9 1011 12 131415 16 17181920 21 222324 25 26272829 30 313233 34 353637 38 39G F E D C B A % 0 1 m o r f d e s a e r c n I - - < % 0 2 h t w o r g s e l a S % 5 1 m o r f d e s a e r c n I - - < % 0 2 s e l a S / s t e s s a t n e r r u C % 8 s e l a S / s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C % 7 7 m o r f d e s a e r c n I - - < % 0 8 s e l a S / s t e s s a d e x i f t e N % 0 5 s e l a S / d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C % 0 1 e t a r n o i t a i c e r p e D % 0 0 . 0 1 t b e d n o e t a r t s e r e t n I Interest paid on cash and marketable securities 8.00% % 0 4 e t a r x a T % 0 4 m o r f d e s a e r c n I - - < % 0 5 o i t a r t u o y a p d n e d i v i D 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y Income statement 0 0 0 , 1 s e l aS 1,200 1,440 1,728 2,074 2,488 ) 0 0 5 ( d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C (600) (720) (864) (1,037) (1,244) ) 0 4 ( t b e d n o s t n e m y a p t s e r e t n I (40) (40) (40) (40) (40) Interest earned on cash and marketable securities 6 4 (0) (6) (13) (21) ) 0 0 1 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D (124) (156) (194) (242) (299) 6 6 3 x a t e r o f e b t i f o r P 440 524 624 742 884 ) 7 4 1 ( s e x a T (176) (210) (249) (297) (354) 0 2 2 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 264 314 374 445 530 ) 0 1 1 ( s d n e d i v i D (132) (157) (187) (223) (265) 0 1 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e R 132 157 187 223 265 Balance sheet 0 8 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a C 28 (36) (113) (209) (325) 0 0 2 s t e s s a t n e r r u C 240 288 346 415 498 Fixed assets 0 0 1 , 1 t s o c t A 1,384 1,732 2,157 2,675 3,306 ) 0 0 3 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D (424) (580) (774) (1,016) (1,315) 0 0 8 s t e s s a d e x i f t e N 960 1,152 1,382 1,659 1,991 Total assets 1,080 1,228 1,404 1,615 1,865 2,163 0 8 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C 96 115 138 166 199 0 0 4 t b eD 400 400 400 400 400 0 5 4 k c o tS 450 450 450 450 450 0 5 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e r d e t a l u m u c c A 282 439 626 849 1,114 Total liabilities and equity 1,080 1,228 1,404 1,615 1,865 2,163 NEGATIVE CASH BALANCES: ILLUSTRATION 7. If you examine the model as it now stands you will see that it implicitly assumes that this extra fi nancing comes at the cost of the cash and marketable securities. If we consider this account a kind of checking account with interest, then the model implicitly assumes that the fi rm can fi nance overdrafts from this account at the same rate of interest as it is being paid on the account. 147 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling Here is the model: 1 2 3 4 56 7 89 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 2829 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39H G F E D C B A % 0 1 m o r f d e s a e r c n I - - < % 0 2 h t w o r g s e l a S % 5 1 m o r f d e s a e r c n I - - < % 0 2 s e l a S / s t e s s a t n e r r u C % 8 s e l a S / s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C % 7 7 m o r f d e s a e r c n I - - < % 0 8 s e l a S / s t e s s a d e x i f t e N % 0 5 s e l a S / d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C % 0 1 e t a r n o i t a i c e r p e D % 0 0 . 0 1 t b e d n o e t a r t s e r e t n I Interest paid on cash and marketable securities 8.00% % 0 4 e t a r x a T % 0 4 m o r f d e s a e r c n I - - < % 0 5 o i t a r t u o y a p d n e d i v i D Yea r 012345 Income statement 0 0 0 , 1 s e l aS 1,200 1,440 1,728 2,074 2,488 ) 0 0 5 ( d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C ( 600) (720) (864) (1,037) (1,244) ) 0 4 ( t b e d n o s t n e m y a p t s e r e t n I (40) (42) (47) (56) (67) Interest earned on cash and marketable securities 6 4 1 - - - ) 0 0 1 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D ( 124) (156) (194) (242) (299) 6 6 3 x a t e r o f e b t i f o r P 440 524 622 739 878 ) 7 4 1 ( s e x a T ( 176) (209) (249) (296) (351) 0 2 2 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 264 314 373 443 527 ) 0 1 1 ( s d n e d i v i D (132) (157) (187) (222) (263) 0 1 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e R 132 157 187 222 263 Balance sheet 0 8 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a C 28 0000 < - - = G 3 9 - G 2 8 - G 3 2 0 0 2 s t e s s a t n e r r u C 240 288 346 415 498 Fixed assets 0 0 1 , 1 t s o c t A 1,384 1,732 2,157 2,675 3,306 ) 0 0 3 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D (424) (580) (774) (1,016) (1,315) 0 0 8 s t e s s a d e x i f t e N 960 1,152 1,382 1,659 1,991 Total assets 1,080 1,228 1,440 1,728 2,074 2,488 0 8 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C 96 115 138 166 199 0 0 4 t b eD 400 436 514 610 728 <-- =MAX(G28+G32-G35-G37-G38,F36) 0 5 4 k c o tS 450 450 450 450 450 0 5 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e r d e t a l u m u c c A 282 439 626 847 1,111 Total liabilities and equity 1,080 1,228 1,440 1,728 2,074 2,488 NO NEGATIVE CASH BALANCES The equations for cash (row 27) and debt (row 36) are indicated for the year-5 entries. What they do, in accounting terms, is the following: • Cash and marketable securities remains the plug in the model. • The debt on the balance sheet conforms to the following test: Ⴜ Current assets + Net fi xed assets > Current liabilities + Last year ’ s debt + Stock + Accumulated retained earnings? In this case even if cash and marketable securities = 0, we need to increase debt balances in order to fi nance the fi rm ’ s productive activities. Ⴜ Current assets + Net fi xed assets < Current liabilities + Last year ’ s debt + Stock + Accumulated retained earnings? 148 Chapter 5 If this relation holds, then there is no need to increase debt and, in fact, the fi rm has to have positive cash and marketable securities as a balancing item, and the fact that we have made cash the plug will take care of this. Ⴜ In Excel programming terms, this formula becomes (for the year 5, but each previous year has the same type of equation): Max(G28 + G32-G35 -G37-G38,F36). As shown in the Exercises for this chapter, the model can easily accom- modate a situation in which there are minimum cash balances. 5.9 Incorporating a Target Debt/Equity Ratio into a Pro Forma Another change we might want to make in our model relates to the plug. Suppose that the fi rm has a target ratio of debt to equity: In each of the years 1–5 it wants the ratio of debt/equity on the balance sheet to conform to a certain ratio. This situation is illustrated in the following example: 149 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling Row 41 of the spreadsheet shows the target debt/equity ratio in each of years 1–5. The fi rm wants to lower its current debt/equity ratio of 53% to 30% over the next 2 years. The relevant changes to the equations of our initial model are the following: • Debt = Target debt/Equity ratio * (Stock + Retained earnings) • Stock = Total assets – Current liabilities – Debt – Accumulated retained earnings Note that the fi rm will issue new debt years 4 and 5; in year 1 the stock account grows (indicating that new equity is issued), whereas in subsequent years stock decreases (indicating a repurchase of equity). 1 23456789 1011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435363738394041AB C D E F G H Sales growth 10% Current assets/Sales 15% Current liabilities/Sales 8% Net fixed assets/Sales 77% Costs of goods sold/Sales 50% Depreciation rate 10% Interest rate on debt 10.00% Interest paid on cash & marketable securities 8.00% Tax rate 40% Dividend payout ratio 60% Year 0 1 2 3 4 5 Income statementSales 1,000 1,100 1,210 1,331 1,464 1,611 Costs of goods sold (500) (550) (605) (666) (732) (805) Interest payments on debt (32) (30) (29) (28) (29) (32) Interest earned on cash & marketable securities 6 6 6 6 6 6 Depreciation (100) (117) (137) (161) (189) (220) Profit before tax 374 409 445 483 521 560 Taxes (150) (164) (178) (193) (208) (224) Profit after tax 225 246 267 290 313 336 Dividends (135) (147) (160) (174) (188) (202) Retained earnings 90 98 107 116 125 134 Balance sheetCash and marketable securities 80 80 80 80 80 80 Current assets 150 165 182 200 220 242 Fixed assets At cost 1,070 1,264 1,486 1,740 2,031 2,364 Depreciation (300) (417) (554) (715) (904) (1,124) Net fixed assets 770 847 932 1,025 1,127 1,240 Total assets 1,000 1,092 1,193 1,305 1,427 1,562 Current liabilities 80 88 97 106 117 129 Debt 320 287 284 276 302 331 <-- =G41*(G37+G38) Stock 450 469 457 451 412 372 <-- =G33-G35-G36-G38 Accumulated retained earnings 150 248 355 471 596 730 Total liabilities and equity 1,000 1,092 1,193 1,305 1,427 1,562 Target debt/equity ratio 0.53 0.40 0.35 0.30 0.30 0.30TARGET DEBT/EQUITY RATIO Cash is fixed, ratio of debt /equity changes in each year Initial (year 0) debt/equity ratio: =B36/(B37+B38) 150 Chapter 5 5.10 Project Finance: Debt Repayment Schedules Here is another use for pro forma modeling: In a typical case of so-called “project fi nance,” the fi rm borrows money in order to fi nance a project. The borrowing often comes with strings attached: • The fi rm is not allowed to pay any dividends until the debt is paid off. • The fi rm is not allowed to issue any new equity. • The fi rm must pay back the debt over a specifi ed period. The following simplifi ed example uses a variation of the version of our basic model with cash balances. A new fi rm or project is set up; in year 0: • The fi rm has assets of 2,200, which are fi nanced with 200 of current liabili- ties, 1,100 of equity, and 1,000 of debt. • The debt must be paid off in equal installments of principal over the next 5 years. Until the debt is paid off, the fi rm is not allowed to pay dividends (if there is extra cash, this will go into a cash and marketable securities account). 151 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling The debt repayment terms are incorporated into the model by simply speci- fying the debt balances at the end of each year. Since the fi rm is assumed to issue no new equity (in accordance with the covenants on the lending), it follows that the model ’ s plug cannot be on the liabilities side of the balance sheet. In our model the plug is the cash and marketable securities account. The model incorporates one other assumption often made about fi xed assets: It assumes that the net fi xed assets stay constant over the life of the project. Essentially this means that the depreciation accurately refl ects the capital maintenance of the fi xed assets. As you can see from looking at rows 29–31 above, this means that the fi xed assets at cost grow each year by the increase in asset depreciation. It also means that there is no net cash fl ow from depreciation: 1 2345 6 789 101112131415 16 1718192021222324 25 2627282930313233 34 35363738H G F E D C B A % 5 1 h t w o r g s e l a S % 5 1 s e l a S / s t e s s a t n e r r u C % 8 s e l a S / s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C % 5 4 s e l a S / d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C % 0 1 e t a r n o i t a i c e r p e D % 0 0 . 0 1 t b e d n o e t a r t s e r e t n I Interest paid on cash and marketable securities 8.00% % 0 4 e t a r x a T f f o d i a p s i t b e d e h t l l a l i t n u s d n e d i v i d o N - - < % 0 o i t a r t u o y a p d n e d i v i D 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y Income statement 1 1 0 , 2 9 4 7 , 1 1 2 5 , 1 3 2 3 , 1 0 5 1 , 1 s e l a S ) 5 0 9 ( ) 7 8 7 ( ) 4 8 6 ( ) 5 9 5 ( ) 8 1 5 ( d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C ) 0 1 ( ) 0 3 ( ) 0 5 ( ) 0 7 ( ) 0 9 ( t b e d n o s t n e m y a p t s e r e t n I 0 4 1 2 9 3 1 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a c n o d e n r a e t s e r e t n I ) 4 1 3 ( ) 4 8 2 ( ) 7 5 2 ( ) 3 3 2 ( ) 1 1 2 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D 2 2 8 9 6 6 9 3 5 8 2 4 3 3 3 x a t e r o f e b t i f o r P ) 9 2 3 ( ) 8 6 2 ( ) 6 1 2 ( ) 1 7 1 ( ) 3 3 1 ( s e x a T 3 9 4 1 0 4 3 2 3 7 5 2 0 0 2 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 0 0 0 0 0 s d n e d i v i D 3 9 4 1 0 4 3 2 3 7 5 2 0 0 2 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e R Balance sheet 1 3 G - 7 2 G - 8 3 G = - - < 3 3 6 9 5 3 3 7 1 4 6 9 1 0 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a C 2 0 3 2 6 2 8 2 2 8 9 1 3 7 1 0 0 2 s t e s s a t n e r r u C Fixed assets 9 9 2 , 3 5 8 9 , 2 0 0 7 , 2 3 4 4 , 2 1 1 2 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 t s o c t A 2 / ) 9 2 F + 9 2 G ( * 6 $ B $ - 0 3 F = - - < ) 9 9 2 , 1 ( ) 5 8 9 ( ) 0 0 7 ( ) 3 4 4 ( ) 1 1 2 ( 0 n o i t a i c e r p e D e g n a h c t ' n o d A F N - - < 0 0 0 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 s t e s s a d e x i f t e N Total assets 2,200 2,192 2,262 2,401 2,621 2,935 1 6 1 0 4 1 2 2 1 6 0 1 2 9 0 0 1 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C 5 / 5 3 $ B $ - 5 3 F = - - < 0 0 0 2 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 8 0 0 0 , 1 t b e D 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 1 , 1 k c o t S 4 7 6 , 1 1 8 1 , 1 0 8 7 6 5 4 0 0 2 0 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e r d e t a l u m u c c A Total liabilities and equity 2,200 2,192 2,262 2,401 2,621 2,935PROJECT FINANCE No dividends, debt repayment schedule fixed, net fixed assets constant 152 Chapter 5 In this example, the fi rm has no problem in making its debt principal repay- ments. As credit analysts, we might be interested in how the fi rm ’ s ability to meet its payments is affected by the various parameter values. In the following example we have increased the ratio of COGS/sales. With the new parameter values, the fi rm can no longer meet its debt repayments in years 1–3. This fact can be seen in the pro forma: In years 1–4 the balances of cash and marketable securities are negative, indicating that—in order to make the repayment of the loan principal—the fi rm had to borrow money. 8 41 42 43 444546 47 4849 50H G F E D C B A FREE CASH FLOW CALCULATION 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y 3 9 4 1 0 4 3 2 3 7 5 2 0 0 2 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 4 1 3 4 8 2 7 5 2 3 3 2 1 1 2 n o i t a i c e r p e d k c a b d d A ) 9 3 ( ) 4 3 ( ) 0 3 ( ) 6 2 ( 8 2 s t e s s a t n e r r u c n i e s a e r c n i t c a r t b u S 1 2 8 1 6 1 4 1 ) 8 ( s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u c n i e s a e r c n i k c a b d d A ) 4 1 3 ( ) 4 8 2 ( ) 7 5 2 ( ) 3 3 2 ( ) 1 1 2 ( t s o c t a s t e s s a d e x i f n i e s a e r c n i t c a r t b u S 6 8 1 0 3 2 4 4 5 t b e d n o t s e r e t n i x a t - r e t f a k c a b d d A Subtract after-tax interest on cash and mkt. securities (0) (2) (6) (13) (24) Free cash flow 273 285 334 391 457Cash flow generated by depreciation equals capital expenditures. 8. From the point of view of corporate fi nance, positive balances of cash are like negative bal- ances of debt. Thus, when the cash is negative, it is equivalent to the fi rm having borrowed money. 153 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling 5.11 Calculating the Return on Equity We can use the pro forma models illustrated in this chapter to compute the anticipated return on equity. Look at the previous example: Equity owners in the project have to pay 1,100 in year 0. During years 1–4 they get no payoffs, but in year 5 they own the company. Suppose that the book value of the assets accurately refl ects the market value. Then at the end of year 5 the equity in the fi rm is worth stock + accumulated retained earnings = 2,255. The return on the equity investment (ROE) is calculated as follows: 1 2 3 456789 1011121314151617 18 192021222324 25 262728 29 3031 32 333435363738H G F E D C B A % 5 1 h t w o r g s e l a S % 5 1 s e l a S / s t e s s a t n e r r u C % 8 s e l a S / s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C % 5 5 s e l a S / d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C % 0 1 e t a r n o i t a i c e r p e D % 0 0 . 0 1 t b e d n o e t a r t s e r e t n I Interest paid on cash and marketable securities 8.00% % 0 4 e t a r x a T f f o d i a p s i t b e d e h t l l a l i t n u s d n e d i v i d o N - - < % 0 o i t a r t u o y a p d n e d i v i D 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y Income statement 1 1 0 , 2 9 4 7 , 1 1 2 5 , 1 3 2 3 , 1 0 5 1 , 1 s e l a S ) 6 0 1 , 1 ( ) 2 6 9 ( ) 6 3 8 ( ) 7 2 7 ( ) 3 3 6 ( d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C ) 0 1 ( ) 0 3 ( ) 0 5 ( ) 0 7 ( ) 0 9 ( t b e d n o s t n e m y a p t s e r e t n I 4 ) 4 ( ) 7 ( ) 6 ( ) 2 ( s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a c n o d e n r a e t s e r e t n I ) 4 1 3 ( ) 4 8 2 ( ) 7 5 2 ( ) 3 3 2 ( ) 1 1 2 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D 5 8 5 9 6 4 0 7 3 7 8 2 5 1 2 x a t e r o f e b t i f o r P ) 4 3 2 ( ) 7 8 1 ( ) 8 4 1 ( ) 5 1 1 ( ) 6 8 ( s e x a T 1 5 3 1 8 2 2 2 2 2 7 1 9 2 1 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 0 0 0 0 0 s d n e d i v i D 1 5 3 1 8 2 2 2 2 2 7 1 9 2 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e R Balance sheet g u l p e h t , 1 3 G - 7 2 G - 8 3 G = - - < 4 1 1 ) 8 1 ( ) 3 8 ( ) 2 9 ( ) 2 5 ( 0 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a C 2 0 3 2 6 2 8 2 2 8 9 1 3 7 1 0 0 2 s t e s s a t n e r r u C Fixed assets 9 9 2 , 3 5 8 9 , 2 0 0 7 , 2 3 4 4 , 2 1 1 2 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 t s o c t A ) 9 9 2 , 1 ( ) 5 8 9 ( ) 0 0 7 ( ) 3 4 4 ( ) 1 1 2 ( 0 n o i t a i c e r p e D e g n a h c t ' n o d A F N - - < 0 0 0 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 0 0 0 , 2 s t e s s a d e x i f t e N Total assets 2 , 2 0 02 , 1 2 12 , 1 0 72 , 1 4 52 , 2 4 42 , 4 1 6 1 6 1 0 4 1 2 2 1 6 0 1 2 9 0 0 1 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C 0 0 0 2 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 8 0 0 0 , 1 t b e D 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 1 , 1 0 0 1 , 1 k c o t S 5 5 1 , 1 4 0 8 3 2 5 1 0 3 9 2 1 0 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e r d e t a l u m u c c A Total liabilities and equity 2,200 2,121 2,107 2,145 2,244 2,416PROJECT FINANCE With these parameters the project cannot pay off its debt 56 57 58 59H G F E D C B A RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE) 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y - 0 0 1 , 1 - w o l f h s a c y t i u q E - - - 2,255 <-- =G22+G36+G37 ) 8 5 G : 8 5 B ( R R I = - - < % 4 4 . 5 1 ) E O R ( Y T I U Q E N O N R U T E R 154 Chapter 5 Note that this equity return increases as the equity investment decreases. 9 Consider the case where the fi rm initially borrows 1,500 and the equity owners invest 600: 56 57 58 59H G F E D C B A RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE) 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y - 0 0 6 - w o l f h s a c y t i u q E - - - 1,602 <-- =G22+G36+G37 ) 8 5 G : 8 5 B ( R R I = - - < % 0 7 . 1 2 ) E O R ( Y T I U Q E N O N R U T E R As the following data table and graph show, the less the initial equity invest- ment, the greater the equity return: 61 6263 64 65 66676869 70 71 727374 75 7677J I H G F E D C B A Data table: ROE as a function of initial 21.70% <-- =B59 , data table header equity investment 2,000 10.80% 1,800 11.43% 1,600 12.19% 1,400 13.14%1,200 14.36%1,000 15.98% 800 18.26% 600 21.70% 400 27.61% 200 40.76%ROE as a Function of Initial Equity Investment 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40%45% 0 250 500 750 1,000 1,250 1,500 1,750 2,000 Equity investment ROE The ROE in Our First Full Model The model in sections 5.3–5.5 has annual dividends. If we use the mid-year discounting explained in section 5.5 to value the fi rm, we can compute the return on equity (ROE) of an investor who purchases the fi rm at date 0 at its imputed equity valuation, gets 5 years of dividends, and sells it for the imputed terminal value of the equity: 9. Interesting but not surprising: As the equity investment goes down, the project becomes more leveraged and hence more risky for the equity investors. The increased return should compensate the equity holders for this extra risk. The really interesting question (not answered here) is whether the increased return is in fact a compensation for the riskiness. 155 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling 5.12 Tax Loss Carryforwards Firms can apply accumulated losses to reduce their current tax liabilities. In this section we show how to model such tax loss carryforwards in our pro forma model. We make a number of changes in our basic model, highlighted below: • We assume that in addition to costs of goods sold that are a proportion of sales, the fi rm also has an annual fi xed cost component of sales (in the Excel clip below, this number is 440 in cell B6). • We assume that in year 0 the fi rm has an initial accumulated tax loss of 100 (cell B11). 1 2 3 4 56789 1011121314 15 5152 53 54 555657 58 59606162 63 6465666768 69 70 7172 73 74H G F E D C B A % 0 1 h t w o r g s e l a S % 5 1 s e l a S / s t e s s a t n e r r u C % 8 s e l a S / s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C % 7 7 s e l a S / s t e s s a d e x i f t e N % 0 5 s e l a S / d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C % 0 1 e t a r n o i t a i c e r p e D % 0 0 . 0 1 t b e d n o e t a r t s e r e t n I Interest paid on cash and marketable securities 8.00% % 0 4 e t a r x a T % 0 4 o i t a r t u o y a p d n e d i v i D Y 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Income statement 0 0 0 , 1 s e l aS 1,100 1,210 1,331 1,464 1,611 Valuing the firm (mid-year discounting) % 0 2 l a t i p a c f o t s o c e g a r e v a d e t h g i e W % 5 e t a r h t w o r g w o l f h s a c e e r f m r e t - g n o L Y 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e 8 2 2 4 1 2 1 0 2 8 8 1 6 7 1 F C F Terminal value 1,598 <-- =G58*(1+B55)/(B54-B55) 6 2 8 , 1 4 1 2 1 0 2 8 8 1 6 7 1 l a t o T 5 . 0 ^ ) 4 5 B + 1 ( * ) 0 6 G : 0 6 C , 4 5 B ( V P N = - - < 8 4 3 , 1 0 6 w o r f o V P N , e u l a v e s i r p r e t n E Add in initial (year 0) cash and mkt. securities 80 <-- =B27 2 6 B + 3 6 B = - - < 8 2 4 , 1 0 r a e y , e u l a v t e s s A 6 3 B - = - - < ) 0 2 3 ( y a d o t t b e d s ' m r i f f o e u l a v t u o t c a r t b u S 5 6 B + 4 6 B = - - < 8 0 1 , 1 e u l a v y t i u q E RETURN ON EQUITY (ROE) Y 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e 8 9 ) 8 0 1 , 1 ( s d n e d i v i d d e t c e j o r P 108 118 129 141 Anticipated equity value, year 5 1,737 <-- Terminal value + year 5 cash - year 5 debt ) 2 7 G : 1 7 G ( M U S = - - < 8 7 8 , 1 9 2 1 8 1 1 8 0 1 8 9 ) 8 0 1 , 1 ( w o l f h s a c y t i u q E ) 3 7 G : 3 7 B ( R R I = - - < % 9 2 . 8 1 ) E O R ( Y T I U Q E N O N R U T E RCOMPUTING THE ROE IN THE FIRST FINANCIAL MODEL 156 Chapter 5 In each year we model the accumulated tax loss (row 29). If the previous year exhibited a loss (for example, year 1, with a loss of 18), then the accu- mulated loss increased by that amount (cell D29). If the previous year exhibits a gain (year 2), then the accumulated tax loss carryforward gets closer to zero (cell D30). At some point (year 5 in our example), tax losses may be com-pletely used up. In any year, the taxable profi ts are given in row 30. If the accumulated tax loss carryforward is greater than that year ’ s profi t, then there is no tax. Oth- erwise only the difference in income is taxed (consider year 4, for example). These differences are refl ected in the effective tax rate in row 31. The effective tax rate is used in computing the free cash fl ows, as shown below: 1 2 3456789 101112131415161718 19 2021222324252627 28 293031H G F E D C B A % 1 1 h t w o r g s e l a S % 5 1 s e l a S / s t e s s a t n e r r u C % 8 s e l a S / s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C % 5 4 s e l a S / s t e s s a d e x i f t e N 0 4 4 s t s o c d e x i F % 5 5 s e l a S / d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C % 0 1 e t a r n o i t a i c e r p e D % 0 0 . 0 1 t b e d n o e t a r t s e r e t n I Interest paid on cash and marketable securities 8.00% 0 0 1 - d r a w r o f y r r a c s s o l - x a t l a i t i n I % 0 4 e t a r x a T % 0 4 o i t a r t u o y a p d n e d i v i D 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y Income statement 0 0 0 , 1 s e l aS 1,110 1,232 1,368 1,518 1,685 ) 0 4 4 ( s t s o c d e x i F (440) (440) (440) (440) <-- =-$B$6 ) 1 1 6 ( d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C (678) (752) (835) (927) 3 t b e d n o s t n e m y a p t s e r e t n I 9 15 21 27 1 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a c n o d e n r a e t s e r e t n I (8) (14) (16) (17) <-- =$B$10*AVERAGE(F34:G34) ) 2 8 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D (96) (112) (130) (152) ) 8 1 ( x a t e r o f e b t i f o r P 20 65 118 177 - s e x a T - - (34) (71) <-- =-MAX($B$12*G30,0) ) 8 1 ( x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 20 65 84 106 - s d n e d i v i D 8 26 34 42 <-- =IF(G25<0,0,$B$13*G25) ) 8 1 ( s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e R 27 91 118 149 ) 0 0 1 ( s r a e y s u o i v e r p m o r f d r a w r o f y r r a c s s o l x a T (118) (99) (34) - <-- =MIN(F29+F23,0) ) 0 , 9 2 G + 3 2 G ( X A M = - - < 7 7 1 4 8 0 0 0 0 t i f o r p e l b a x a T 3 2 G / 4 2 G - = - - < % 0 4 % 9 2 % 0 % 0 % 0 e t a r x a t e v i t c e f f EMODELING TAX LOSS CARRYFORWARDS 48 495051 52 53545556 57H G F E D C B A 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y Free cash flow calculation 6 0 1 4 8 5 6 0 2 ) 8 1 ( x a t r e t f a t i f o r P 2 5 1 0 3 1 2 1 1 6 9 2 8 n o i t a i c e r p e d k c a b d d A ) 5 2 ( ) 3 2 ( ) 0 2 ( ) 8 1 ( ) 7 1 ( s t e s s a t n e r r u c n i e s a e r c n i t c a r t b u S 3 1 2 1 1 1 0 1 9 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u c n i e s a e r c n i k c a b d d A ) 7 2 2 ( ) 8 9 1 ( ) 3 7 1 ( ) 1 5 1 ( ) 1 3 1 ( t s o c t a s t e s s a d e x i f n i e s a e r c n i t c a r t b u S 0 2 G * ) 1 3 $ C $ - 1 ( - = - - < ) 7 2 ( ) 1 2 ( ) 5 1 ( ) 9 ( ) 3 ( t b e d n o t s e r e t n i x a t - r e t f a k c a b d d A Subtract after-tax interest on cash and mkt. securities (1) 8 14 16 17 <-- =-(1-$C$31)*G21 Free cash flow (79) (45) (7) 1 9 157 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling 5.13 Summary Pro forma modeling is one of the basic skills of corporate fi nancial analysis, a devious combination of fi nance, the implementation of accounting rules, and spreadsheet skills. In order to be useful, fi nancial models must match the situ-ation at hand, but they must also be simple enough so that the user can easily understand why the results happen (be they valuations, credit-worthiness, or simply commonsense predictions of how a fi rm or project might look several years down the road). Exercises 1. Here ’ s a basic exercise that will help you understand what ’ s going on in the modeling of fi nancial statements. Replicate the model in section 5.1. That is, enter the correct formulas for the cells and see that you get the same results as the book. (This turns out to be more of an exercise in accounting than in fi nance. If you ’ re like many fi nancial modelers, you ’ ll see that there are some aspects of accounting that you ’ ve forgotten!) 2. The model of section 5.1 includes costs of goods sold but not selling, general, and admin- istrative (SG&A) expenses. Suppose that the fi rm has $200 of these expenses each year, irrespective of the level of sales. a. Change the model to accommodate this new assumption. Show the resulting profi t and loss statements, balance sheets, the free cash fl ows, and the valuation. b. Do a data table in which you show the sensitivity of the equity value to the level of SG&A. Let SG&A vary from $0 per year to $600 per year. 3. Suppose that in the model of section 5.1 the fi xed assets at cost for years 1–5 are 100% of sales (in the current model, it is net fi xed assets which are a function of sales). Change the model accordingly. Show the resulting profi t and loss statements, balance sheets, and free cash fl ows for years 1–5. (Assume that in year 0, the fi xed assets accounts are as shown in section 5.2. Note that since year 0 is given—it is the current situation of the fi rm, whereas years 1–5 are the predictions for the future—there is no need for the year 0 ratios to conform to the predicted ratios for years 1–5.) 4. Back to the basic model of section 5.1. Suppose that the fi xed assets at cost follow the following step function: Fixed Assets at CostSales Sales Sales =∗≤ +∗ −100 1 200 1 200 90 1%, ,%if ,, , , ,% , ,200 1 200 1 400 1 380 80 1 400 1 400() <≤ +∗ − () >Sales Sales Sales⎧ ⎧ ⎨⎪ ⎩⎪ Incorporate this function into the model. 5. Consider the model in section 5.6 (where debt is the plug). a. Suppose that the fi rm has 1,000 shares and that it decides to pay, in year 1, a dividend per share of 15 cents. In addition, suppose that it wants this dividend per share to grow in subsequent years by 12% per year. Incorporate these changes into the pro forma model. 158 Chapter 5 b. Do a sensitivity analysis in which you show the effect on the debt/equity ratio of the annual growth rate of dividends. Vary this rate from 0% to 18%, in steps of 2%. For this exercise, defi ne debt as net debt (i.e., debt – cash and marketable securities). (Note that since the WACC = 20%, the growth rate must be less than 20%.) 6. In the model of section 5.6, assume that the fi rm needs to have minimum cash balances of 25 at the end of each year. Introduce this constraint into the model. 7. In the valuation exercise of section 5.4, the terminal value is calculated using a Gordon dividend model on the cash fl ows. Replace this terminal value by the year 5 book value of debt + equity. This means that you are essentially assuming that the book value correctly predicts the market value. 8. Repeat the above exercise, but this time replace the terminal value by an EBITDA (earn- ings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ratio times year-5 anticipated EBITDA. Show a graph of the equity value of the fi rm as a function of the assumed year 5 EBITDA ratio, varying this ratio from 6–14. 9. In the project fi nance pro forma of section 5.8 it is assumed that the fi rm pays off its initial debt of 1,000 in equal installments of principal over 5 years. Change this assumption and assume instead that the fi rm pays off its debt in equal payments of interest and principal over 5 years. Hint: This means that you have to use the PMT function to fi nd the annual payments, then set up a loan table (as in Chapter 1) to split the annual payments into an interest and repayment of principal. Alternatively you can use the functions PPMT and IPMT dis- cussed in Chapter 34. 10. This problem introduces the concept of “sustainable dividends”: The fi rm whose fi nancials are illustrated below wishes to maintain cash balances of 80 over the next 5 years. It also desires to issue neither additional stock nor make any changes in its current level of debt. This means that dividends are the plug in the balance sheet. Model this situation (note that for some parameter levels you may get “negative dividends,” indicating that there is no sustainable level of dividends). 159 Pro Forma Financial Statement Modeling 1 2 345 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 192021 22 2324 25 2627 28 2930 31 323334 35 3637 38G F E D C B A % 0 1 h t w o r g s e l a S % 5 1 s e l a S / s t e s s a t n e r r u C % 8 s e l a S / s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C % 7 7 s e l a S / s t e s s a d e x i f t e N % 0 5 s e l a S / d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C % 0 1 e t a r n o i t a i c e r p e D % 0 0 . 0 1 t b e d n o e t a r t s e r e t n I Interest paid on cash & marketable securities 8.00% % 0 4 e t a r x a T 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y Income statement 0 0 0 , 1 s e l aS ) 0 0 5 ( d l o s s d o o g f o s t s o C ) 2 3 ( t b e d n o s t n e m y a p t s e r e t n I Interest earned on cash & marketable securities 6 ) 0 0 1 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D 4 7 3 x a t e r o f e b t i f o r P ) 0 5 1 ( s e x a T 5 2 2 x a t r e t f a t i f o r P ) 0 9 ( s d n e d i v i D 5 3 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e R Balance sheet 0 8 s e i t i r u c e s e l b a t e k r a m d n a h s a C 80 80 80 80 80 0 5 1 s t e s s a t n e r r u C Fixed assets 0 7 0 , 1 t s o c t A ) 0 0 3 ( n o i t a i c e r p e D 0 7 7 s t e s s a d e x i f t e N Total assets 1,000 0 8 s e i t i l i b a i l t n e r r u C 0 2 3 t b eD 320 320 320 320 320 0 5 4 k c o tS 450 450 450 450 450 0 5 1 s g n i n r a e d e n i a t e r d e t a l u m u c c A Total liabilities and equity 1,000 SUSTAINABLE DIVIDENDS--Template 6 Building a Pro Forma Model: The Case of Caterpillar 6.1 Overview In this chapter we implement the pro forma modeling techniques discussed in Chapter 5 to build a fi nancial model for Caterpillar, Inc. Caterpillar, as most readers of this book will surely know, is a world leader in the manufacture and sales of large-scale earth-moving equipment. Our energies in this chapter will be to understand Caterpillar ’ s fi nancial statements for the years 2007–2011 in order to fi t them into the format illus- trated in Chapter 5. This is not a trivial task, and it requires a combination of understanding of CAT ’ s business, modeling skills, and a small dose of fi nancial deviousness (otherwise we would never get to the end of the exercise). Warning: This Chapter May Be Deleterious to Your Mental Health 1 The material in this chapter is irritating and complicated but not diffi cult . Why irritating? Because pro forma fi nancial models require a lot of assumptions and analysis. Everything is related to almost everything else. And because they require you to recall some basic accounting concepts. This is all irritating! However, the case in this chapter illustrates one of the most important cor- porate fi nance applications: The valuation of a company in the framework of its accounting and fi nancial parameters. Such valuations are the core of most business plans, corporate fi nancial planning models, and (intelligent) analyst valuations. 1.

Our model is forward looking but based on CAT ’ s historical fi nancial statements. Our choices of model parameters is based on our analysis of the historicals and on a number of judgment calls. Sales Projections The sales projection is one of the most critical elements in our model. Should it be based on a historical analysis of Caterpillar sales? Or should it be based on expert opinions about the potential growth of the heavy-equipment indus-try? Should we differentiate between short-term (next 5 years) growth and long-term growth? None of these questions has a satisfactory answer. We illustrate several methods and suggest that you use the pro forma model to experiment with the various answers to see whether they have a value impact. In the Excel below we show: • Year-on-year sales growth • Cumulative average growth rates (CAGR) • Regression of sales on the year 167 Building a Pro Forma Model: The Case of Caterpillar 1 2 3456789 101112131415161718 19 2021222324252627282930313233AB C D E F G H I J K L YearSales of machineryRevenues of financial productsTotal sales and revenuesYear-on- year growth 2000 18,913 1,262 20,1752001 19,027 1,423 20,450 1.36%2002 18,648 1,504 20,152 -1.46%2003 21,048 1,759 22,807 13.17%2004 28,336 1,970 30,306 32.88%2005 34,006 2,333 36,339 19.91%2006 28,869 2,648 31,517 -13.27% 2007 41,962 2,996 44,958 42.65%2008 48,044 3,280 51,324 14.16%2009 29,540 2,856 32,396 -36.88%2010 39,867 2,721 42,588 31.46%2011 57,392 2,746 60,138 41.21% CAGR 10.44% <-- =(D14/D3)^(1/11)-1 Slope 3,169 <-- =SLOPE(D3:D14,A3:A14) Slope/2011 sales5.27% <-- =B18/D14 Intercept -6,320,495 <-- =I NTERCEPT(D3:D14,A3:A14) R-squared 0.7579 <-- =RSQ(D3:D14,A3:A14) 2001-2011 11.39% <-- =(D14/D4)^(1/10)-1 2002-2011 12.92% <-- =(D14/D5)^(1/9)-12003-2011 12.88% <-- =(D14/D6)^(1/8)-12006-2011 13.79% <-- =(D14/D9)^(1/5)-1 2001-2010 8.49% <-- =(D13/D4)^(1/9)-1 2002-2010 9.80% <-- =(D13/D5)^(1/8)-1 2003-2010 9.33% <-- =(D13/D6)^(1/7)-1 2005-2010 3.22% <-- =(D13/D8)^(1/5)-1Growth measures CAGR is very affected by end points!ANALYSIS OF CATERPILLAR SALES y = 3168.7x - 6E+06 R² = 0.7579 010,00020,00030,00040,00050,00060,00070,000 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011Caterpillar Sales Regressed on Year Total sales and revenues Linear (Total sales and revenues) -50%-40%-30%-20%-10%0%10%20%30%40%50% 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012CATERPILLAR, YEAR-ON-YEAR GROWTH We focus on two numbers in the above Excel: • The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in cell B17 is CAGRSales Sales=⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ −=⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ 2011 20001 11 11 0 4 4 .% . CAGR is often used but because of its dependence on the endpoints, it is a problematic number. We fi nd it a suspect measure of long-term growth, unless verifi ed by other time spans. As the second chart above shows, the year-on-year growth of CAT exhibits a lot of variability. In the Excel above we have played with these end points, and fi nd that the CAGR can vary from 3.22% to 13.79%. • Regressing the annual sales on the year is not dependent solely on the start-ing and ending sales, and thus often provides a better estimation of future sales growth: 168 Chapter 6 Sales a b Year Year Rtt=+∗ =− + ∗ =6 320 495 3 169 75 792,, , , . % This regression line suggests that sales will grow at a rate of about 3,169 annually. Impounding this estimate into the current sales (cell B14 above) gives an annual growth rate of about 5.27%. On the whole we fi nd this a more satisfactory estimate of sales growth. 2 Current Assets and Current Liabilities The ratio of current assets to sales and current liabilities to sales shows a lot of stability over the 5 years. As model parameter values we have chosen the average of the 5 years. 2. Our baseline prejudice is that for a company in an established, old-line business, growth rate should be approximately the economy ’ s real growth rate plus the infl ation rate. The 5.27% number falls in the framework of this prejudice. 1 2 34 5 6789 10 11 12131415 16 1718192021 22AB C D E F 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 CA/Sales 54.17% 56.30% 68.99% 66.26% 58.32% CL/Sales 25.90% 26.05% 28.37% 32.96% 31.45% Model values CA/Sales 58.32% <-- =F3 CL/Sales 31.45% <-- =F4CATERPILLAR ANALYSIS OF RATIOS 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80% 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011NWC Analysis CA/Sales CL/Sales 169 Building a Pro Forma Model: The Case of Caterpillar Operating Costs Like most industrial companies Caterpillar ’ s operating costs include deprecia- tion. Following the model in Chapter 5, we want to separate depreciation from other operating costs, so we refer to the consolidated statement of cash fl ows to compute the operating costs without depreciation.

Fixed Assets and Sales We need to determine a model for the fi xed assets of Caterpillar. This involves two decisions: • Are fi xed assets best modeled by assuming that the critical model ratio is Net FA/Sales or Gross FA/Sales? We have a slight predilection toward the former, believing it to make more economic sense. 3 • What is the applicable average depreciation rate? In this subsection we deal with the fi rst question. The depreciation rate is discussed in the next section. 3. If depreciation has any economic meaning, then producing more sales should require more net fi xed assets. 171 Building a Pro Forma Model: The Case of Caterpillar 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 13 1415 16 17F E D C B A 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 3 5 7 2 8 6 9 3 6 5 7 5 9 8 1 d n a L Buildings and land improvements 3,625 4,647 4,914 5,174 5,857 Machinery, equipment and other 9,756 12,173 12,917 13,414 14,435 Equipment leased to others 4,556 4,561 4,717 4,444 4,285 Construction-in-process 1,082 1,531 1,034 1,192 1,996 Total property, plant and equipment, at cost 19,208 23,487 24,221 24,906 27,326 Less: Accumulated depreciation -9,211 -10,963 -11,835 -12,367 -12,931 Property, plant and equipment—net 9,997 12,524 12,386 12,539 14,395 Sales 44,958 51,324 32,396 42,588 60,138 Net PPE/Sales 22.24% 24.40% 38.23% 29.44% 23.94% % 4 4 . 5 4 % 8 4 . 8 5 % 7 7 . 4 7 % 6 7 . 5 4 % 2 7 . 2 4 s e l a S / E P P s s o r G Model value: Net PPE/Sales 25.00% <-- =AVERAGE(B15,C15,E15,F15)CATERPILLAR—ANALYSIS OF FIXED ASSETS There appears to be a slightly better connection between the Net PPE and Sales than the Gross PPE, and this is accordingly the value we use in our model. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80% 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Net PPE/Sales Gross PPE/Sales 172 Chapter 6 Depreciation Note 8 of the Caterpillar 2011 annual report gives the approximate lives of different fi xed asset classes: In row 28 below we use SumProduct to compute the weighted average depreciation rate for CAT.

Cost of Debt Caterpillar is a highly rated borrower in fi nancial markets. A chart from Morn-ingstar (http://quicktake.morningstar.com/stocknet/bonds.aspx?symbol = cat) shows the term structure of CAT ’ s debt. We will assume that the company ’ s average cost of debt is 4%. 175 Building a Pro Forma Model: The Case of Caterpillar Interest Earned on Cash and Short-Term Securities At the time this chapter is written, short-term interest rates are very low. We will assume that CAT earns 1% on its short-term cash investments. What ’ s the Plug? The plug should be one of the following fi nancial items: cash and marketable securities, debt, or treasury stock. After some analysis, we use the cash/sales and the debt/assets ratios below. This leaves treasury stock as the plug in our model. 1 23456789 10111213AB C D E F G 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Sales 44,958 51,324 32,396 42,588 60,138 <-- ='Page 162'!F5 Cash 1,122 2,736 4,867 3,592 3,057 <-- ='Page 163'!F4 Cash/Sales 2.50% 5.33% 15.02% 8.43% 5.08% <-- =F5/F3 Debt 28,429 35,535 31,631 28,418 34,592 <-- ='Page 165'!F19 Debt/Sales 63.23% 69.24% 97.64% 66.73% 57.52% <-- =F7/F3 Debt/Total assets 50.65% 52.43% 52.68% 44.39% 42.47% <-- =F7/'Page 163'!F20 Model valuesCash/Sales 5.08% <-- =F6 Debt/Assets 42.47% <-- =F9CATERPILLAR: VARIOUS PLUGS vs SALES AND OTHER 176 Chapter 6 6.4 A Model for Caterpillar Using the values computed for Caterpillar, we arrive at the following pro forma model for the company: 1 2 3456789 10111213141516171819 202122 23 24252627282930 3132 333435363738394041 4243 444546474849505152535455AB C D E F G H Sales growth 5.27% <-- ='Page 167'!B19 Current assets/Sales 58.32% <-- ='Page 168'!B6 Current liabilities/Sales 31.45% <-- ='Page 168'!B7 Net fixed assets/Sales 27.65% <-- =AVERAGE('Page 171-173'!B15:F15) Cost of goods sold/Sales 83.90% <-- ='Page 169-170'!F7 Long-term receivables, growth 5.27% <-- Assume this grows at the same rate as sales Depreciation rate 13.26% <-- ='Page 171-173'!B29 Pension liabilities, growth 17.88% <-- ='Page 174'!B12 Other liabilities, growth 9.83% <-- ='Page 174'!B6 Cash/Sales 5.08% <-- ='Page 175'!B12 Debt/Assets 42.47% <-- ='Page 175'!B13 Interest rate on debt 1.41% <-- ='Ratios (5)'!F18 Interest paid on cash & mkt. sec. 0.00% <-- Author guesstimate Tax rate 25.58% <-- ='Page 174, middle'!B6 Dividend growth 8.22% <-- ='Page 173'!B6 Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Income statement Sales 60,138 63,307 66,642 70,154 73,850 77,742 <-- =F20*(1+$B$2) Costs of goods sold -50,458 -53,117 -55,915 -58,862 -61,963 -65,228 <-- =-$B$6*G20 Interest payments on debt -521 -543 -567 -592 -618 <-- =-$B$13*G50 Interest earned on cash & marketable securities 0 000 0 <-- =$B$14*AVERAGE(F32:G32) Depreciation -2,527 -3,711 -4,524 -5,301 -6,196 -7,225 <-- =G38-F38 Profit before tax 7,153 5,958 5,659 5,424 5,100 4,671 <-- =SUM(G20:G24) Taxes -1,720 -1,524 -1,448 -1,387 -1,305 -1,195 <-- =-$B$15*G25 Profit after tax 5,433 4,434 4,212 4,036 3,795 3,476 <-- =G25+G26 Dividends 1,159 1,254 1,357 1,469 1,590 1,720 <-- =F28*(1+$B$16) Retained earnings 5,688 5,569 5,505 5,385 5,196 <-- =G27+G28 Balance sheet 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 <-- 2016 Cash and marketable securities 3,057 3,218 3,388 3,566 3,754 3,952 <-- =$B$11*G20 Current assets 35,071 36,919 38,864 40,912 43,068 45,337 <-- =$B$3*G20 Fixed assets <-- Land 753 753 753 753 753 753 <-- =F35 Construction in progress 1,996 1,996 1,996 1,996 1,996 1,996 <-- =F36 Depreciable assets at cost 24,577 31,397 36,844 43,117 50,335 58,635 <-- =G39-G38-G36-G35 Accumulated depreciation -12,931 -16,642 -21,167 -26,468 -32,664 -39,889 <-- =F38-$B$8*AVERAGE(F37:G37) Net PPE 14,395 17,504 18,427 19,398 20,420 21,496 <-- =$B$5*G20 <-- Long-term receivables 13,078 13,767 14,493 15,256 16,060 16,906 <-- =F41*(1+$B$7) Investments in unconsolidated affiliated companies 133 133 133 133 133 133 <-- =F42 Noncurrent deferred and refundable income taxes 2,157 2,157 2,157 2,157 2,157 2,157 <-- =F43 Intangibles and other 13,555 13,555 13,555 13,555 13,555 13,555 <-- =F44 Total assets 81,446 87,253 91,016 94,977 99,147 103,536 <-- =G32+G33+G39+SUM(G41:G44) <-- Current liabilities 18,913 19,910 20,959 22,063 23,225 24,449 <-- =$B$4*G20 Pension liabilities 10,956 12,915 15,224 17,946 21,155 24,937 <-- =F48*(1+$B$9) Other liabilities 3,583 3,935 4,322 4,748 5,214 5,727 <-- =F49*(1+$B$10) Debt 34,592 37,059 38,657 40,339 42,110 43,974 <-- =$B$12*G45 Redeemable noncontrolling interest 473 473 473 473 473 473 <-- =F51 Stock 2,744 2,744 2,744 2,744 2,744 2,744 <-- =F52 Treasury stock -9,451 -12,868 -20,018 -27,496 -35,320 -43,511 <-- =G45-SUM(G47:G52)-G54 Accumulated retained earnings 17,398 23,086 28,655 34,161 39,545 44,742 <-- =F54+G29 Total liabilities and equity 79,208 87,253 91,016 94,977 99,147 103,536 <-- =SUM(G47:G54)CATERPILLAR PRO FORMA MODEL 177 Building a Pro Forma Model: The Case of Caterpillar This model gives the following free cash fl ow projections: 58 5960616263 64 656667H G F E D C B A 6 1 0 2 5 1 0 2 4 1 0 2 3 1 0 2 2 1 0 2 1 1 0 2 r a e Y Free Cash Flow 7 2 G = -

A Data Table on the long-term growth rate and the weighted average cost of capital produces the following table. Cells with a valuation greater than the current market value of 90.60 are highlighted, and where the WACC < long- term growth, the cells have been blanked, since this does not accord with the valuation model (see section 5.4). Note that for some combinations, the model predicts that the value of the equity is negative—meaning that Caterpillar ’ s year 0 debt outweighs the value of its equity. 178 Chapter 6 6.6 Summary On one hand, the pro forma fi nancial model is an extraordinarily labor- intensive method of valuing the fi rm. On the other hand, in modeling Caterpil-lar, we have discovered much about the way the fi rm operates and about how much we understand (and don ’ t … ) about its fi nancial statements. The pro forma modeling technique cannot be undertaken lightly, but if an intensive investigation into the fi rm ’ s workings is needed, this is the way to go. 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 9596 97 98AB C D E F G LT growth rate ↓ 44.74 6.0% 7.0% 8.0% 9.0% 10.0% WACC--> 6.0% 6.5% 389.00 7.0% 160.45 7.5% 84.25 374.31 =IF(B70>B71,B84,\"\") 8.0% 46.13 153.15 8.5% 23.24 79.40 360.22 9.0% 7.97 42.51 146.14 9.5% -2.94 20.37 74.75 346.69 10.0% -11.14 5.59 39.04 139.41 10.5% -17.52 -4.97 17.61 70.29 333.71 7 Financial Analysis of Leasing 7.1 Overview A lease is a contractual arrangement by which the owner of an asset (the lessor ) rents the assets to a lessee . In this chapter we analyze long-term leases, in which the asset spends most of its useful life with the lessee. In economic terms, the leases we consider in this chapter are considered by the lessees as alternatives to purchasing an asset. The analysis of this chapter fi ts many long-term equipment leases, but not short-term leasing (car rentals, for example). Financial theory regards such leases as being essentially debt contracts: For the lessee, the lease is an alternative to purchasing the asset with debt, and the lessor understands that it is essentially providing fi nancing for the lessee. In the example that follows we consider a company that is faced with the choice of either purchasing or leasing a piece of equipment. We assume that the operating infl ows and outfl ows from the equipment are not affected by its ownership—irrespective of how the asset is held (whether owned or leased), the owner/lessee will have the same sales and must bear the responsibility for maintaining the equipment. In the words of Statement 13 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB 13), the lease we are considering is one that “transfers substantially all of the benefi ts and risks incident to the owner-ship of property” to the lessee. The analysis in this chapter concentrates exclusively on the cash fl ows from the lease. It is assumed that the lessor pays taxes on the income from the lease rentals and gets a tax shield on the depreciation of the asset, and that the lessee can claim the rent as an expense. The analysis assumes that the tax authorities treat the lessor as the owner of the asset and the lessee as the user. 1 7.2 A Simple but Misleading Example The essence of our analysis can be understood from the following simple example: A company has decided to acquire the use of a machine costing $600,000. If purchased, the machine will be depreciated on a straight-line basis to a residual value of zero. The machine ’ s estimated life is 6 years, and the company ’ s tax rate T C is 40%. 1. From an economic point of view this assumption is not innocuous: If the lessee has true eco- nomic ownership of the asset, why doesn ’ t it get to take the depreciation? But the facts are otherwise. 180 Chapter 7 The company ’ s alternative to purchasing the machine is to lease it for 6 years. A lessor has offered to lease the machine to the company for $140,000 annually, with the fi rst payment to be made today and with fi ve additional payments to be made at the start of each of the next 5 years. One way of analyzing this problem (a misleading way, as it turns out) is to compare the present values of the cash fl ows to the company of leasing and of buying the asset. The company feels that the lease payment and the tax shield from depreciation are riskless. Suppose, furthermore, that the risk-free rate is 12%. On the basis of the following calculation, the company should lease the asset. 2 NPV leasingT Lease rental Tc t tc() %,=−() ∗ +()=−() ∗ =∑1 11 21 140 00 050 0 11 2386 801 05 +()= =−=∑%, ()t t NPV buying Asset cost PV tax shields o nn depreciation t t() =−∗ +()= =∑ 600 0000 40 100 000 11 2435 544 16 ,., %, In a spreadsheet: 2. At this point we assume that the residual value of the asset at the end of its life is zero. In section 7.5 we drop this assumption. 1 2 345 6 789C B A Asset cost 600,000 Interest rate 12% Lease rental payment 140,000 Annual depreciation 100,000 % 0 4 e t a r x a T NPV (leasing) 386,801 <-- =-PV(B3,5,B4*(1-B6))+B4*(1-B6) NPV (buying) 435,544 <-- =B2+PV(B3,6,B6*B5)HOW NOT TO ANALYZE A LEASE This analysis suggests that leasing the asset is preferable to buying it. However, it is misleading because it ignores the fact that leasing is very much like buying the asset with a loan. The fi nancial risks are thus different when we compare a lease (implicitly a purchase with loan fi nancing) against a straightforward purchase without loan fi nancing. If the company is willing to lease the asset, then perhaps it should also be willing to borrow money to buy 181 Financial Analysis of Leasing the assets. This borrowing will change the cash-fl ow patterns and could also produce tax benefi ts. Hence, our decision about the leasing decision could change if we were to take the loan potential into account. In the following section we present a method of analyzing leases that deals with this problem by imagining what kind of loan would produce cash fl ows (and hence fi nancial risks) equivalent to those produced by the lease. This method of lease analysis is called the equivalent-loan method. 7.3 Leasing and Firm Financing—The Equivalent-Loan Method The idea behind the equivalent-loan method is to devise a hypothetical loan that is somehow equivalent to the lease. 3 It then becomes easy to see whether the lease or the purchase of an asset is preferable. The easiest way to understand the equivalent-loan method is with an example. We return to the previous example: 3. This method is due to Myers, Dill, and Bautista (1976). A somewhat more accessible explana- tion can be found in Levy and Sarnat (1979). 1 2 34567 8 9 101112131415161718 19 2021AB C D E F G H I 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 t s o c t e s s A % 2 1 e t a r t s e r e t n I Lease rental payment 140,000 Annual depreciation 100,000 % 0 4 e t a r x a T Y 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e After-tax cash flows from leasingAfter-tax lease rental -84,000 -84,000 -84,000 -84,000 -84,000 -84,000 <-- =-$B$4*(1-$B$6) After-tax cash flows from buying the asset 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 - t s o c t e s s A 6 $ B $ * 5 $ B $ = - - < 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 d l e i h s x a t n o i t a i c e r p e D Net cash from buying -600,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 <-- =G13+G14 Differential cash flow: Lease saves lessee Lease minus buy 516,000 -124,000 -124,000 -124,000 -124,000 -124,000 -40,000 <-- =G10-G15 IRR of differential cash flow 8.30% <-- =IRR(B18:H18,0) ) \" y u B \" , \" e s a e L \" , 3 B * ) 6 B - 1 ( < 0 2 B ( F I = - - < y u B ? ? n o i s i c e DEQUIVALENT-LOAN METHOD—THE LESSEE POINT OF VIEW Rows 2–6 give the various parameters of the problem. The spreadsheet then compares two after-tax cash fl ows, that of the lease and that of the buy; we write outfl ows with a minus sign and infl ows (such as the tax shield from the depreciation) with a plus sign. 182 Chapter 7 • The cash fl ow from leasing the asset is (1 – tax rate) *lease payment in each of years 0–5. • The cash fl ow from buying the asset is the asset cost in year 0 (an outfl ow, hence negative) and the tax shield on the asset ’ s depreciation, tax rate *depre- ciation , in years 1–6 (an infl ow, hence written here with a positive sign). The differential cash fl ow between the lease and the buy decision. This line shows that leasing the asset, instead of buying it, results in the following cash fl ows to the lessor: • A cash infl ow of $516,000 in year 0. This infl ow is the cash saved at time 0 by the lease: Purchasing the asset costs $600,000, whereas leasing the asset costs only $84,000 on an after-tax basis. Thus the lease initially saves the lessee $516,000. • A cash outfl ow of $124,000 in years 1–5 and an outfl ow of $40,000 in year 6. This outfl ow corresponds to the after-tax cost of the lease versus the buy in these years. This cost has two components: the after-tax lease payment ($84,000) and the fact that when the lessee leases, it does not get the tax shield on the asset ’ s depreciation ($40,000). Thus leasing instead of purchasing the asset is like getting a loan of $516,000 with after-tax repayments of $124,000 in years 1–5 and an after-tax repayment of $40,000 in year 6. The lease, in other words, can be viewed as an alternative method of fi nancing the asset. In order to compare the lease to the buy, we should compare the cost of this fi nancing with the cost of alternative fi nancing . The internal rate of return of the differential cash fl ows—8.30%—gives the after-tax cost of the fi nancing implicit in the lease; this is larger than the after-tax cost of fi rm borrowing, since in this case (where the fi rm ’ s tax rate is 40% and its borrowing cost is 12%), this cost is 7.20%. Our conclusion: Buying is preferable to leasing. Why Do We Decide Against the Lease? Not everyone is fully convinced by the preceding argument. We therefore present an alternative argument in this subsection. We show that if the fi rm can borrow at 12%, it can borrow more money with the same schedule of after- tax repayments as that which resulted from the lease versus the buy. This hypothetical loan is shown in the following table: 183 Financial Analysis of Leasing The table (a version of the loan tables discussed in Chapter 1) shows the principal of a hypothetical bank loan bearing a 12% interest rate. At the begin-ning of year 0 (that is, at the time when the fi rm either purchases or leases the asset), for example, the fi rm borrows $532,070 from the bank. At the end of the year, the fi rm repays $149,539 to the bank, of which $63,848 is interest (since $63,848 = 12%*$532,070) and the remainder, $85,691, is repayment of principal. The net, after-tax, repayment in year 1—assuming full tax deduct-ibility of the interest payment—is (1 – 40%)*$63,848 + $85,691 = $124,000, which is, of course, the same after-tax differential cash fl ow calculated in our original spreadsheet. Payments in subsequent years are calculated similarly to the illustration in the preceding paragraph. At the beginning of year 6, there is still $37,313 of principal outstanding; this is fully paid off at the end of the year with an after-tax payment of $40,000. The point of this example? If the fi rm is considering leasing the asset in order to get the fi nancing of $516,000, which the lease gives, it should instead borrow $532,070 from the bank at 12%; it can repay this larger loan with the same after-tax cash fl ows as are implicit in the lease. The bottom line: Purchas-ing is still preferable to leasing the asset.24 25 262728 29 303132 33 34AB C D E F G H =D26+B26-B27 =B26-B27 YearPrincipal at beg. yearLoan payment, end yearInterestRepayment of principalAfter-tax loan repaymentLease minus buy cash flows, years 1-6 1 532,070 149,539 63,848 85,691 124,000 124,000 2 446,379 145,426 53,565 91,861 124,000 124,000 3 354,518 141,017 42,542 98,475 124,000 124,000 4 256,044 136,290 30,725 105,565 124,000 124,000 5 150,479 131,223 18,057 113,166 124,000 124,000 63 7,313 41,791 4,478 37,313 40,000 40,000 Split of loan repayment between: =NPV((1-$B$6)*$B$3,G26:$G$31)<-- {=- TRANSPOSE (C18:H18)} =$B$3*B26 184 Chapter 7 The alternative loan table shown above was constructed in the following way: The principal at the beginning of each of years 1–6 is the present value of the lease versus buy outfl ows, discounted at (1 − 38%)*12%.

One way of solving the lessor ’ s problem is to turn the above analysis around. We use the Excel Goal Seek ( Data|What-if analysis|Goal Seek ) to get $134,826 as the lessor ’ s minimum acceptable rental: 185 Financial Analysis of Leasing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 20H G F E D C B A 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 t s o c t e s s A % 2 1 e t a r t s e r e t n I Lowest acceptable lease payment 134,822 <-- Computed either with Goal Seek or Solve r 0 0 0 , 0 0 1 n o i t a i c e r p e d l a u n n A % 0 4 e t a r x a T Year 0123456 Lessor after-tax cash flows from leasing 3 9 8 , 0 8 3 9 8 , 0 8 3 9 8 , 0 8 3 9 8 , 0 8 3 9 8 , 0 8 3 9 8 , 0 8 l a t n e r e s a e l x a t - r e t f A Lessor after-tax cash flows from buying the asset 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 - t s o c t e s s A 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 d l e i h s x a t n o i t a i c e r p e D Net cash from buying -600,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 Lessor cash flows 0 0 0 , 0 4 3 9 8 , 0 2 1 3 9 8 , 0 2 1 3 9 8 , 0 2 1 3 9 8 , 0 2 1 3 9 8 , 0 2 1 7 0 1 , 9 1 5 - y u b + e s a e L IRR of differential cash flow 7.22% <-- =IRR(B18:H18)THE LESSOR'S PROBLEM Calculating the lowest acceptable lease rate Here ’ s what the Goal Seek settings look like: If you ’ re using Data|Solver to do this problem, it would look like: 186 Chapter 7 Mini-Case: When Is Leasing Profi table for Both the Lessor and Lessee? The symmetry between the lessee ’ s problem and the lessor ’ s problem suggests that if the lessee wants to lease, it will not be profi table for the lessor to pur- chase the asset in order to lease it out. In some cases, however, it may be that the differences in tax rates between the lessee and the lessor make it profi table for both to enter into a leasing arrangement. Here is an example: Greenville Electric Corp. is a public utility which pays no taxes. Its credit rating is of the highest order, since all of Green-ville ’ s debts are guaranteed by the city of Greenville. Greenville Electric has decided that it requires a new turbine. The turbine costs $10,000,000 and will be depreciated to zero salvage value over 5 years. Greenville Electric borrows at 6%. Greenville can either lease or buy the plant. The lease offer it has is $1,800,000 per year for 6 years (starting today); the lessee is a captive leasing subsidiary of United Turbine Corp., the manufacturer of the turbine. United Turbine Leasing also borrows at 6% and has a tax rate of 40%. As can be seen below, the lease is profi table to both lessor and lessee. Greenville Electric gets fi nancing at a cost of 3.19%, compared to its borrow-ing cost of 6%; United Turbine gets an after-tax return of 4.3%, compared to its after-tax borrowing cost of 3.6%. Both Greenville Electric and United Turbine profi t. 4 4. Who loses? The government, of course! What makes the lease profi table is the utilization of otherwise unused depreciation tax shields. 187 Financial Analysis of Leasing 1 2 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 161718 19 20 21 22 23 2425 26 2728 29 303132 33 3435 36H G F E D C B A 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 1 t s o c e n i b r u T % 0 0 . 6 e t a r g n i w o r r o b s ' e l l i v n e e r G 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 , 1 t n e m y a p e s a e L Y 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Lessee after-tax lease costs , 0 0 8 , 1 - 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 , 1 - l a t n e r e s a e l x a t - r e t f A 000 -1,800,000 -1,800,000 -1,800,000 -1,800,000 Lessee after-tax purchase costs 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 1 - t s o c t e s s A 0 0 0 0 0 0 ) 0 = e t a r x a t s ' c i r t c e l E e l l i v n e e r G ( d l e i h s x a t n o i t a i c e r p e D 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 1 - g n i y u b m o r f h s a c t e N Cash saved by leasing , 0 0 8 , 1 - 0 0 0 , 0 0 2 , 8 s w o l f h s a c e s a h c r u p - e s a e L 000 -1,800,000 -1,800,000 -1,800,000 -1,800,000 0 ) 0 , 6 1 H : 6 1 B ( R R I = - - < % 9 1 . 3 w o l f h s a c l a i t n e r e f f i d f o R R I 3 B = - - < % 0 0 . 6 t s o c g n i w o r r o b x a t - r e t f a s ' e l l i v n e e r G 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 1 t s o c e n i b r u T 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 , 1 t n e m y a p e s a e L 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 2 ) s r a e y 5 , e n i l t h g i a r t s ( n o i t a i c e r p e D % 0 0 . 6 e t a r g n i w o r r o b s ' e n i b r u T d e t i n U % 0 4 e t a r x a t e t a r o p r o c s ' e n i b r u T d e t i n U Y 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Lessor cash flows 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , 0 1 - t s o c t n e m p i u q E , 1 0 0 0 , 0 8 0 , 1 x a t r e t f a , t n e m y a p e s a e L 080,000 1,080,000 1,080,000 1,080,000 1,080,000 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 d l e i h s x a t n o i t a i c e r p e D , 0 8 8 , 1 0 0 0 , 0 2 9 , 8 - w o l f h s a c r o s s e l l a t o T 000 1,880,000 1,880,000 1,880,000 1,880,000 800,000 ) 3 3 H : 3 3 B ( R R I = - - < % 0 3 . 4 s w o l f h s a c r o s s e l f o R R I ) 6 2 B - 1 ( * 5 2 B = - - < % 0 6 . 3 t s o c g n i w o r r o b x a t - r e t f a s ' e n i b r u T d e t i n UGREENVILLE ELECTRIC CORP. UNITED TURBINE LEASING CORPORATION 7.5 Asset Residual Value and Other Considerations In the above example we have ignored the residual value of the asset—its anticipated market value at the end of the lease term. In a mechanical sense, it is easy to include the residual value in the calculations (but you have to be careful with this—see the warning after the numerical example below). Suppose, for example, you think that the asset will have a market value of $100,000 in year 7; assuming that this value is fully taxed (after all, we ’ ve depreciated the asset to zero value over the fi rst 6 years), the after-tax residual value will be (1 – Tax rate ) *$100,000 = $60,000. 188 Chapter 7 Not surprisingly, the possibility of realizing an extra cash fl ow from asset ownership makes the lease even less attractive than before (you can see this difference by noting that the return rate in cell B22, the IRR of the differential cash fl ows, has increased from 8.30% in our original example to 10.49%). Be a bit careful here, however; the spreadsheet treats the residual value as if it has the same certainty of realization as the depreciation tax shields and the lease rentals. This can be far from the truth! There is no good practical solution to this problem; an ad hoc way of dealing with it might be to reduce the $100,000 by a factor which expresses the uncertainty about its realization. The fi nance technical jargon for this is “certainty equivalent factor,” and you can fi nd it referenced in any basic fi nance text. 5 The last spreadsheet snapshot in this chapter (below) assumes that you ’ ve decided that the certainty-equivalence factor for the residual value is 0.7: 12 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23AB C D E F G H I 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 t s o c t e s s A % 2 1 e t a r t s e r e t n I Lease rental payment 140,000 Annual depreciation 100,000 % 0 4 e t a r x a T Residual value 100,000 <-- Anticipated to be realized in year 7; fully taxed Year 01234567 After-tax cash flows from leasing After-tax lease rental -84,000 -84,000 -84,000 -84,000 -84,000 -84,000 After-tax cash flows from buying the asset 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 - t s o c t e s s A 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 d l e i h s x a t n o i t a i c e r p e D After-tax residual 60,000 Net cash from buying -600,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 40,000 60,000 Differential cash flowLease minus buy 516,000 -124,000 -124,000 -124,000 -124,000 -124,000 -40,000 -60,000 IRR of differential cash flow 10.49% <-- =IRR(B20:I20,0) ) \" y u B \" , \" e s a e L \" , 3 B * ) 6 B - 1 ( < 2 2 B ( F I = - - < y u B ? ? n o i s i c e DRESIDUAL VALUES IN LEASE ANALYSIS 5. For further references on certainty-equivalents, see for example Brealey-Myers-Allen (2011, Chapter 9). However, note that neither this work nor the present text (nor anyone else) can tell you precisely how to calculate the certainty-equivalence factor. It depends on your attitudes toward risk. 189 Financial Analysis of Leasing 7.6 Leveraged Leasing Up to this point we analyzed the lease versus purchase decision from both the points of view of the lessee (the long-term user of the asset) and the lessor (the asset ’ s owner, who rents it out to the lessee). In this chapter we analyze leveraged leasing: In a leveraged lease the lessor fi nances the purchase of the asset to be leased with debt. From the point of view of the lessee, there is no difference in the analysis of a leveraged or a non-leveraged lease. From the lessor ’ s point of view, however, the cash fl ows of a leveraged lease present some interesting problems. At least six parties are typically involved in a leveraged lease: the lessee, the equity partners in the lease, the lenders to the equity partners, an owner trustee, an indenture trustee, and the manufacturer of the asset. In most cases, a seventh party is also involved: a lease packager (a broker or leasing company). Figure 7.1 on page 190 illustrates the arrangements among the six parties of a typical leveraged lease. The two major problems related to the analysis of leveraged leases are these: • The straightforward fi nancial analysis of the lease from the point of view of the lessor . This concerns the calculation of the cash fl ows obtained by the lessor, and a computation of these cash fl ows’ net present value (NPV) or internal rate of return (IRR). • The accounting analysis of the lease . Accountants use a method called the multiple phases method (MPM) to calculate a rate of return on leveraged 1 23 4 56 7 89 10111213 14 1516 17 181920 21 2223 24J I H G F E D C B A 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 t s o c t e s s A % 2 1 e t a r t s e r e t n I 0 0 0 , 0 4 1 t n e m y a p l a t n e r e s a e L 0 0 0 , 0 0 1 n o i t a i c e r p e d l a u n n A % 0 4 e t a r x a T d e x a t y l l u f ; 7 r a e y n i d e z i l a e r e b o t d e t a p i c i t n A - - < 0 0 0 , 0 0 1 e u l a v l a u d i s e R Certainty-equivalence factor for residual 0.70 Year 01234567 After-tax cash flows from leasing 0 0 0 , 4 8 - 0 0 0 , 4 8 - 0 0 0 , 4 8 - 0 0 0 , 4 8 - 0 0 0 , 4 8 - 0 0 0 , 4 8 - l a t n e r e s a e l x a t - r e t f A After-tax cash flows from buying the asset 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 - t s o c t e s s A 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 d l e i h s x a t n o i t a i c e r p e D After-tax residual 42,000 <-- =(1-B6)*B7*B8 0 0 0 , 2 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 4 0 0 0 , 0 0 6 - g n i y u b m o r f h s a c t e N Differential cash flow 0 0 0 , 2 4 - 0 0 0 , 0 4 - 0 0 0 , 4 2 1 - 0 0 0 , 4 2 1 - 0 0 0 , 4 2 1 - 0 0 0 , 4 2 1 - 0 0 0 , 4 2 1 - 0 0 0 , 6 1 5 y u b s u n i m e s a e L ) 0 , 1 2 I : 1 2 B ( R R I = - - < % 8 8 . 9 w o l f h s a c l a i t n e r e f f i d f o R R I ) \" y u B \" , \" e s a e L \" , 3 B * ) 6 B - 1 ( < 3 2 B ( F I = - - < y u B ? ? n o i s i c e DRESIDUAL VALUES IN LEASE ANALYSIS Estimated residual value multiplied by ce rtainty-equivalence factor which represents uncertainty about realizing residual 190 Chapter 7 leases. The MPM rate of return is different from the internal rate of return (IRR). In an ordinary fi nancial context this should be of no concern, since the effi cient-markets hypothesis tells us that only cash fl ows matter. However, in a less than effi cient world, people tend to get very concerned about how things look on their fi nancial statements. Since the accounting rate of return on the lease is diffi cult to compute, we will use Excel to calculate it; then we will analyze the results. 7.7 A Leveraged Lease Example We can explore these issues by considering an example, roughly based on an example given in Appendix E of FASB 13, the accounting profession ’ s magnum opus on accounting for leases. A leasing company is considering the purchase of an asset whose cost is $1,000,000. The asset will be purchased with $200,000 of the company ’ s equity and with $800,000 of debt. The interest on the debt is 10%, so that the annual payment of interest and principal over the 15-year term of the debt is $105,179. 6 6. Using Excel: = PMT(10%,15,-800000) gives 105,179.

The lease term is 15 years. The asset will be depreciated over a period of 8 years, using standard IRS depreciation schedule for assets with a 7-year life. 7 The depreciation schedule for such assets is: Year Depreciation 1 14.28% 2 24.49% 3 17.49% 4 12.5% 5 8.92% 6 8.92% 7 8.92% 8 4.48% Because the asset will be fully depreciated at the time it is sold (year 16), the whole anticipated residual value ($300,000) will be taxable. Since the com-pany ’ s tax rate is 40%, this means that the after-tax cash fl ow from the residual is (1 – 40%) *300,000 = $180,000. These facts are summarized in the spreadsheet below, which also derives the lessor ’ s cash fl ows: 7. The depreciation schedule we use is referred to as the modifi ed cost recovery system (MACRS) depreciation. More information can be obtained from an introductory fi nance text or from many websites (one example: www.real-estate-owner.com/depreciation-chart.html ). 192 Chapter 7 The last column gives the cash fl ow to the equity owners of the asset. A typical year ’ s cash fl ow for the equity owner is calculated as follows: Cash flow t Tax Lease payment Tax Depreciation Tax()=−() ∗+ ∗ −−() ∗1 1 IInterest t Principal repayment t ()− () The cash fl ows of the typical long-lived leveraged lease are usually positive at the beginning of the lease term, and then decline over time, turning positive again at the end, when the residual value is received. There are three reasons for this phenomenon: • The cash fl ow which stems from depreciation typically ends or falls off rapidly before the end of the lease term. The more accelerated the depreciation method, the larger will be the depreciation allowances (and hence the larger the depreciation tax shields) at the beginning of the asset ’ s life. • In the later years of the lease, the portion of the annual debt payments devoted to interest (tax-deductible) falls, while the portion of the annual debt payments that constitutes a repayment of principal (not tax deductible) rises. • Finally, of course, we anticipated a large cash fl ow from the realization of the asset ’ s residual value at the end of the lease term. 1 2 34567 8 9 1011 12 1314151617 18 1920212223 24 25 2627282930 31AB C D E F G H I J Cost of asset 1,000,000 5 1 m r e t e s a e L Residual value 300,000 <-- Realized year 16 0 0 0 , 0 0 2 y t i u q E l a p i c n i r p d n a t s e r e t n i f o s t n e m y a p l a u q e , n a o l m r e t r a e y - 5 1 - - < 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 t b e D % 0 1 t s e r e t n I Annual debt payment 105,179 <-- =PMT(B7,B3,-B6) Annual rent received 110,000 % 0 4 e t a r x a T YearEquity InvestedRental or salvageDepreciationPrincipal at start of yearLoan paymentInterestRepayment of principalCash flow to equity 0 -200,000 -200,000 1 4 9 , 9 4 9 7 1 , 5 2 0 0 0 , 0 8 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 0 0 0 , 0 0 8 0 0 8 , 2 4 1 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 1 4 7 7 , 9 8 7 9 6 , 7 2 2 8 4 , 7 7 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 1 2 8 , 4 7 7 0 0 9 , 4 4 2 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 2 6 6 6 , 0 6 7 6 4 , 0 3 2 1 7 , 4 7 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 4 2 1 , 7 4 7 0 0 9 , 4 7 1 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 3 7 8 4 , 9 3 3 1 5 , 3 3 6 6 6 , 1 7 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 7 5 6 , 6 1 7 0 0 0 , 5 2 1 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 4 7 2 8 , 3 2 5 6 8 , 6 3 4 1 3 , 8 6 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 4 4 1 , 3 8 6 0 0 2 , 9 8 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 5 2 5 3 , 2 2 1 5 5 , 0 4 8 2 6 , 4 6 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 0 8 2 , 6 4 6 0 0 2 , 9 8 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 6 0 3 7 , 0 2 6 0 6 , 4 4 3 7 5 , 0 6 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 8 2 7 , 5 0 6 0 0 2 , 9 8 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 7 6 8 1 , 1 7 6 0 , 9 4 2 1 1 , 6 5 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 2 2 1 , 1 6 5 0 0 8 , 4 4 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 8 7 9 6 , 8 1 - 3 7 9 , 3 5 6 0 2 , 1 5 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 6 5 0 , 2 1 5 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 9 6 5 8 , 0 2 - 1 7 3 , 9 5 8 0 8 , 5 4 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 2 8 0 , 8 5 4 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 0 1 1 3 2 , 3 2 - 8 0 3 , 5 6 1 7 8 , 9 3 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 1 1 7 , 8 9 3 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 1 1 3 4 8 , 5 2 - 9 3 8 , 1 7 0 4 3 , 3 3 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 3 0 4 , 3 3 3 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 2 1 6 1 7 , 8 2 - 3 2 0 , 9 7 6 5 1 , 6 2 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 5 6 5 , 1 6 2 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 3 1 7 7 8 , 1 3 - 5 2 9 , 6 8 4 5 2 , 8 1 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 2 4 5 , 2 8 1 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 4 1 4 5 3 , 5 3 - 7 1 6 , 5 9 2 6 5 , 9 9 7 1 , 5 0 1 7 1 6 , 5 9 0 0 0 , 0 1 1 5 1 0 0 0 , 0 8 1 0 0 0 , 0 0 3 6 1 IRR of cash flows 12.46% <-- =IRR(I13:I29) =(1-tax)*C14+tax*D14-(1-tax)*G14- H14BASIC LEVERAGED LEASE EXAMPLE 193 Financial Analysis of Leasing 7.8 Summary This chapter has looked at the lease-purchase decision. We have examined the decision to lease as a purely fi nancing decision, assuming (i) that all opera-tional factors between leasing and buying are equivalent, and (ii) that the essential fi rm decision to acquire the use of the asset has already been made. On the basis of these assumptions, the lease-purchase decision can be made using the equivalent-loan method. A leveraged lease is an arrangement whereby the lessor—the owner of the asset—fi nances his investment with a combination of debt and equity. In this chapter we analyzed the equity income of the lessor in a leveraged lease. The economic analysis of the lease cash fl ows shows that at some point in the lease life, the equity owner has negative equity value. Exercises 1. Your company is considering either purchasing or leasing an asset which costs $1,000,000. The asset, if purchased, will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over 6 years to a zero residual value. A leasing company is willing to lease the asset for $300,000 per year; the fi rst payment on the lease is due at the time the lease is undertaken (i.e., year 0), and the remaining 5 payments are due at the beginning of years 1–5. Your company has a tax rate T C = 40% and can borrow at 10% from its bank. a. Should your company lease or purchase the asset? b. What is the maximum lease payment it will agree to pay? 2. ABC Corp. is considering leasing an asset from XYZ Corp. Here are the relevant facts: Asset cost $1,000,000 Depreciation schedule year 1: 20% year 2: 32% year 3: 19.20% year 4: 11.52% year 5: 11.52% year 6: 5.76% Lease term 6 years Lease payment $200,000 per year, at the beginning of years 0, 1, … , 5. Asset residual value zero Tax rates ABC: T C = 0% (ABC has tax-loss carryforwards which prevent it from utilizing any additional tax shields) XYZ: T C = 40% 194 Chapter 7 ABC ’ s interest costs are 10% and XYZ ’ s interest costs are 7%. Show that it will be advan- tageous both for ABC to lease the asset and for XYZ to purchase the asset in order to lease it out to ABC. 3. Continuing with the above example: Find the maximum rental which ABC will pay and the minimum rental which XYZ will accept. 4.

The consortium includes a 20% equity investment and an 80% debt component. The debt has an interest rate of 8% annually, and is a term loan over 10 years. At the end of each of the next 10 years, HA will pay a lease payment of $35 million. At the end of the 10-year lease term, Hemp has the option to buy the aircraft for $10 million each; it is anticipated that it will exercise this option in which the planes are priced at their anticipated fair market value. The airplanes will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over 5 years to zero salvage value. If the equity partner in the lease has a tax rate of 35%, what is its expected compound rate of return? II PORTFOLIO MODELS Modern portfolio theory, which has its origins in the work of Harry Markowitz, John Lintner, Jan Mossin, and William Sharpe, represents one of the great advances in finance. Chapters 8–14 implement some of the ideas of these researchers and show you how to compute the standard portfolio problems in finance. In these chapters we make intensive use of Excel ’ s matrix functions, array functions, and data tables (see Chapters 32, 34, and 31). Chapter 8 reviews the basic mechanics of portfolio calculations. Starting with price data, we calculate asset and portfolio returns. We start with a simple two-asset problem and then generalize to multiple asset portfolio calculations. Chapter 9 discusses both the theory and the mechanics of the calculation of efficient portfolios when there are no restrictions on short sales. Using Excel ’ s matrix functions we can calculate two efficient portfolios, which can then be used to plot the whole efficient frontier. The remaining chapters of this section discuss computational and imple- mentation issues: • Chapter 10 shows how to use return data to calculate the variance-covariance matrix. Excel ’ s matrix-handling capabilities make it easy to do this calculation. • Chapter 11 discusses the computation of beta, and we replicate a simple test of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). We use some market data to derive the security market line (SML). We then relate the results to Roll ’ s criticism of these tests. Excel makes it easy to do the regression analysis required for these tests. (Regressions are discussed in Chapter 33.) • The preceding chapters have assumed that portfolio optimizers could sell securities short. In Chapter 12 we show how to use Excel ’ s Solver to compute efficient portfolios when short sales are not allowed. We also show how to integrate other portfolio constraints into the optimization problem. • Chapter 13 discusses the Black-Litterman model. This widely used model takes as its starting point the optimality of the benchmark portfolio and uses this assumption to derive the market ’ s expected returns. The optimizer can then adjust the asset allocation to account for his own opinions. • Chapter 14 shows how to do an event study, which is an attempt to determine whether a particular event in the capital market or in the life of a company affected a company ’ s stock market performance. The event-study methodology aims to separate company-specific events from market and/or industry specific events and has often been used as evidence for or against market efficiency. 8 Portfolio Models—Introduction 8.1 Overview In this chapter we review the basic mechanics of portfolio calculations. We start with a simple example of two assets, showing how to derive the return distributions from historical price data. We then discuss the general case of N assets; for this case it becomes convenient to use matrix notation and exploit Excel ’ s matrix handling capabilities. It is useful before going on to review some basic notation: Each asset i (assets may be stocks, bonds, real estate, or whatever, although our numerical examples will be largely confi ned to stocks) is characterized by several statis-tics: E ( r i ), the expected return on asset i ; Var ( r i ), the variance of asset i ’ s return; and Cov ( r i , r j ), the covariance of asset i ’ s and asset j ’ s returns. Occasionally we will use μ i to denote the expected return on asset i . In addition, it will often be convenient to write Cov ( r i , r j ) as σ ij and Var ( r i ) as σ ii (instead of σi2 , as usual). Since the covariance of an asset ’ s returns with itself, σ ii = Cov ( r i , r i ), is in fact the variance of the asset ’ s returns, this notation is not only economical but also logical. 8.2 Computing Returns for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) In this section we compute the return statistics for two stocks: Apple (stock symbol AAPL) and Google (GOOG). Here is the price and return data. The returns include the dividends; see Appendix 8.1 for more details. 198 Chapter 8 1 2 3 4567 8 9 1011 12 13666768 69 7071AB C D E F G Monthly mean 2.61% -0.24% <-- =AVERAGE(F11:F71) Monthly variance 0.0125 0.0102 <-- =VAR.S(F11:F71) Monthly standard deviation 11.17% 10.09% <-- =STDEV.S(F11:F71) Annual mean 31.31% -2.91% <-- =12*C2 Annual variance 0.1497 0.1221 <-- =12*C3 Annual standard deviation 38.70% 34.94% <-- =SQRT(12)*C4 Date AAPL Google AAPL Google 1-Jun-07 122.04 580.11 2-Jul-07 131.76 645.90 0.0766 0.1074 <-- =LN(C12/C11) 1-Aug-07 138.48 599.39 0.0497 -0.0747 <-- =LN(C13/C12) 3-Jan-12 456.48 522.70 0.1197 0.0246 <-- =LN(C66/C65) 1-Feb-12 542.44 497.91 0.1725 -0.0486 <-- =LN(C67/C66) 1-Mar-12 599.55 471.38 0.1001 -0.0548 2-Apr-12 583.98 458.16 -0.0263 -0.0284 1-May-12 577.73 449.45 -0.0108 -0.0192 1-Jun-12 584.00 501.50 0.0108 0.1096PRICES AND RETURNS FOR APPLE AND GOOGLE June 2007 - June 2012 These data give the closing price at the end of each month for each stock. We defi ne the return as rP Ptt t=⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ −ln 1 At the top of the Excel sheet we calculate the return statistics for each stock. The monthly return is the percentage return that would be earned by an investor who bought the stock at the end of a particular month t − 1 and sold it at the end of the following month. Note that we use the continuously compounded return on the stock, r t = ln( P t / P t − 1 ). An alternative would have been to use the discrete return, P t / P t − 1 − 1. Appendix 2 at the end of this chapter discusses the reasons for our choice of the continuously compounded return. We now make a heroic assumption: We assume that the return data for the 60 months represent the distribution of the returns for the coming month. We thus assume that the past gives us some information about the way returns will behave in the future. This assumption allows us to assume that the average of the historic data represents the expected monthly return from each stock. It also allows us to assume that we may learn from the historic data what is the variance of the future returns. Using the Average, Var.s , and Stdev.s functions in Excel, we calculate the statistics for the return distribution: 199 Portfolio Models—Introduction Note: Sample Versus Population Statistics and Excel We interrupt this discussion of portfolio computations with a short note on the statistical computations. In statistics it is common to distinguish between sample statistics and population statistics. If we examine the whole range of possibilities for a given random variable, then we are dealing with the popula- tion . If we are dealing with a set of outcomes for the random variable, then we are dealing with a sample . In the case of portfolio return statistics we will almost always be dealing with a sample rather than the whole population. The table below gives the defi nitions of the population and sample statistics and the Excel functions that compute them.2 3 4 5 6 7 8AB C D E F Monthly mean 2.61% -0.24% <-- =AVERAGE(F11:F71) Monthly variance 0.0125 0.0102 <-- =VAR.S(F11:F71) Monthly standard deviation 11.17% 10.09% <-- =STDEV.S(F11:F71) Annual mean 31.31% -2.91% <-- =12*C2 Annual variance 0.1497 0.1221 <-- =12*C3 Annual standard deviation 38.70% 34.94% <-- =SQRT(12)*C4 Population Sample Mean, average, μ Average = =∑1 1Nri iN Average = =∑1 1Nri iN Variance Var p .=− () =∑1 2 1Nrri iN Var s .=−−() =∑1 12 1 Nrri iN Standard deviation Stdev p .=− () =∑1 2 1Nrri iN Stdev s .=−−() =∑1 12 1 Nrri iN Covariance Covariance p .= −() −() =∑1 1Nrr rrit i jt j tN Covariance s .= −−() −() =∑1 11 Nrr rrit i jt j tN Correlation CorrelCovar p Stdev p Stdev pCovar s(, ).( , ) .( ) .( ).(, )ijij ijij=∗=SStdev s Stdev s .() .()ij∗ 200 Chapter 8 Population Sample Alternative Excel from previous versions, still work Var, VarP, Stdev, StdevP VarS, StdevS Covar computes the population covariance.

All of this discussion about population versus sample statistics may not matter much. We like the point of view stated by Press et al. in their splendid book Numerical Recipes : “There is a long story about why the denominator is N − 1 instead of N . If you have never heard that story, you may consult any good statistics text. We might also comment that if the difference between N and N − 1 ever matters to you, then you are up to no good anyway—e.g., trying to substantiate a questionable hypothesis with marginal data.” 1 Back to Our Portfolio Example Next we want to calculate the covariance of the returns. 1 23 4 5 5960 61 6263 64 656667 68 697071 72 7374 75 76H G F E D C B A Date AAPL Google AAPL Google Product 2-Jul-07 7.66% 10.74% =B4-$B$65 --> 0.0505 0.1099 0.0056 <-- =E4*F4 1-Aug-07 4.97% -7.47% =B5-$B$65 --> 0.0237 -0.0723 -0.0017 <-- =E5*F5 8 6 0 0 . 0 - 2 6 4 0 . 0 - 4 6 4 1 . 0 % 6 8 . 4 - % 5 2 . 7 1 2 1 - b e F - 1 9 3 0 0 . 0 - 3 2 5 0 . 0 - 0 4 7 0 . 0 % 8 4 . 5 - % 1 0 . 0 1 2 1 - r a M - 1 4 1 0 0 . 0 0 6 2 0 . 0 - 4 2 5 0 . 0 - % 4 8 . 2 - % 3 6 . 2 - 2 1 - r p A - 2 6 0 0 0 . 0 8 6 1 0 . 0 - 9 6 3 0 . 0 - % 2 9 . 1 - % 8 0 . 1 - 2 1 - y a M - 1 7 1 0 0 . 0 - 0 2 1 1 . 0 3 5 1 0 . 0 - % 6 9 . 0 1 % 8 0 . 1 2 1 - n u J - 1 % 4 2 . 0 - % 1 6 . 2 e g a r e v A ) 3 6 C : 4 C ( S .

William H. Press et al., Numerical Recipes (Cambridge University Press, 1986), p. 456. 201 Portfolio Models—Introduction The column Product contains the multiple of the deviation from the mean in each month, i.e., the terms ( r WMT , t − E ( r WMT ))( r TGM , t − E ( r TGT )), for t = 1, … , 12. The population covariance is Average(product) = 0.0020. While it is worthwhile calculating the covariance this way at least once, there is a shorter way which is also illustrated above: The Excel functions Covariance . P(AAPL,GOOG) and Covariance.S(AAPL,GOOG) calculate the population and the sample covariance directly. 2 There is no necessity to fi nd the difference between the returns and the means. Simply use Covariance.P or Covariance.S directly on the columns, as illustrated above. The covariance is a hard number to interpret, since its size depends on the units in which we measure the returns. (If we were to write the returns in percentages—i.e., 4 instead of 0.04—then the covariance would be 20, which is 10,000 times the number we just calculated.) We can also calculate the cor- relation coeffi cient ρ AB , which is defi ned as ρσσAAPL GOOGAAPL GOOG AAPL GOOGCov r r ,(, )= The correlation coeffi cient is unit-free; calculating it for our example gives ρ AAPL , GOOG = 0.1765. As illustrated above, the correlation coeffi cient can be calculated directly in Excel using the function Correl(AAPL,GOOG) . The correlation coeffi cient measures the degree of linear relation between the returns of Stock A and Stock B. The following facts can be proven about the correlation coeffi cient: • The correlation coeffi cient is always between + 1 and − 1: − 1 ≤ ρ AB ≤ 1. • If the correlation coeffi cient is + 1, then the returns on the two assets are linearly related with a positive slope; i.e., if ρ AB = 1, then rc d r dAt Bt =+ > , where 0 • If the correlation coeffi cient is − 1, then the returns on the two assets are linearly related with a negative slope; i.e., if ρ AB = − 1, then rc d r dAt Bt =+ < , where 0 2. The function Covar was used in pre-Excel 2013 and calculates the population covariance; it still works in current versions. As noted elsewhere, previous Excel versions had functions VarP , StdevP , VarS , StdevS (though still working, these are now replaced by Var.P , Stdev.P , Var.S , Stdev.S ). Note how, in our example, the difference between the sample and population covariance is very small. 202 Chapter 8 • If the return distributions are independent, then the correlation coeffi cient will be zero. (The opposite is not true: If the correlation coeffi cient is zero, this does not necessarily mean that the returns are independent. See the Exer- cises for an example.) A Different View of the Correlation Coeffi cient Another way to look at the correlation coeffi cient is to graph the Apple and Google returns on the same axes and then use the Excel Trendline facility to regress the returns of GOOG on those of AAPL. (The use of Excel ’ s Trendline function—used to calculate the regression equation—is explained in Chapter 33.) You can confi rm from the previous calculations that the regression R 2 is the correlation squared: y = 0.1594x - 0.0066 R² = 0.0312 -30%-20%-10%0%10%20% -42% -32% -22% -12% -2% 8% 18%Graphing GOOG (y-axis) against AAPL (x-axis) and using Trendline Note that R2= correla/g415on2 8.3 Calculating Portfolio Means and Variances In this section we show how to do the basic calculations for a portfolio ’ s mean and variance. Suppose we form a portfolio invested equally in AAPL and GOOG. What will be the mean and the variance of this portfolio? It is worth doing the brute force calculations at least once in Excel: 203 Portfolio Models—Introduction 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 1011 12 13 14 15 16 17AB C D E Proportion of AAPL 0.5 Proportion of GOOG 0.5 <-- =1-B2 AAPL returnGOOG returnPortfolio return 2-Jul-07 7.66% 10.74% 9.20% <-- =$B$2*B6+$B$3*C6 1-Aug-07 4.97% -7.47% -1.25% <-- =$B$2*B7+$B$3*C7 4-Sep-07 10.28% -1.13% 4.57% <-- =$B$2*B8+$B$3*C8 1-Oct-07 21.33% -14.03% 3.65% 1-Nov-07 -4.15% 4.91% 0.38% 3-Dec-07 8.35% 10.97% 9.66% 2-Jan-08 -38.07% -17.58% -27.83% 1-Feb-08 -7.95% 4.37% -1.79% 3-Mar-08 13.79% 2.81% 8.30% 1-Apr-08 19.24% 7.55% 13.40% 1-May-08 8.17% 4.44% 6.30% 2-Jun-08 -11.98% -2.15% -7.06%CALCULATING THE MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF A PORTFOLIO Computing the statistics for this example: 5 6789 10111213141516171819GH I J G O O G L P A A s n r u t e r t e s s A ) 5 6 C : 6 C ( E G A R E V A = - - < % 4 2 . 0 - % 1 6 . 2 n r u t e r n a e M ) 5 6 C : 6 C ( S .

In this section we extend this discussion to portfolios of more than two assets. For this case, matrix notation greatly simplifi es the writing of the portfolio problem. 3 In the general case of N assets, suppose that the proportion of asset i in the portfolio is denoted by x i . We require that xi i∑ =1 , but we place no restrictions on the signs of the x i ; if x i > 0, this 3. Chapter 32 gives an introduction to matrices suffi cient to deal with all the problems encoun- tered in this book. The Excel matrix functions MMult and MInverse used in portfolio problems are discussed in this chapter. 206 Chapter 8 indicates a purchase of asset i and if x i < 0, this indicates a short sale. 4 We usually write the portfolio composition x and the vector of means E ( r ) as column vectors (we make no pretense at consistency—when convenient we will write these as row vectors): xx x x xErEr Er Er Er NN=⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥=⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢ 1 2 31 2 3 /vertellipsis/vertellipsis()() () () ()⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥ We may then write x T and E ( r ) T as the transpose of these two vectors: x x x x Er Er Er ErT NT N =[] () =() () ( )[] 12 1 2 ,, , , , , , …… The expected return of the portfolio whose proportions are given by X is the weighted average of the expected returns of the individual assets: Er x Er xi i iN () ( )= =∑ 1 which, in matrix notation, can be written as: Er x Er xEr Er x pi i iN T T()= ()= ()=() =∑ 1 The portfolio ’ s variance is given by Var r x Var r x x Cov r r Xi i iN ij i j jiN iN () , =() ( ) + () == + =∑∑ ∑2 11 12 This looks bad, but it is really a straightforward extension of the expression for the variance of a portfolio of two assets which we had before: Each asset ’ s variance appears once, multiplied by the square of the asset ’ s proportion in the portfolio; the covariance of each pair of assets appears once, multiplied by twice the product of the individual assets’ proportions. Another way of writing the variance is to use the notation Var r Cov r r ii i i ji j()= () = σσ,, 4. In Chapter 12 we discuss portfolio optimization when there are short-sale restrictions. In the meantime we assume that short selling is unrestricted. 207 Portfolio Models—Introduction In this case the variance of portfolio x is: Var r x x Xi jij j i() =∑ ∑ σ The most economical representation of the portfolio variance uses matrix notation. It is also the easiest representation to implement for large portfolios in Excel. In this representation we call the matrix that has σ ij in the i th row and the j th column the variance-covariance matrix : SN N N NNN N N=⎡ ⎣⎢σσσ σ σσσ σ σσσ σ σσσ σ11 12 13 1 21 22 23 2 31 32 33 3 123/midhorizellipsis /midhorizellipsis/midhorizellipsis /vertellipsis /midhorizellipsis⎢ ⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥ Then the portfolio variance is given by Var ( r p ) = x T Sx . In Excel formulas, this is written as the array function mmult(mmult(transpose(x),S),x) . 5 Computing the Covariance Between Two Portfolios If we have two portfolios represented as row vectors, x = [ x 1 , x 2 , … , x N ] and y = [ y 1 , y 2 , … , y N ], then the covariance of the two portfolios is given by Cov ( x , y ) = xSy T = ySx T . In Excel formulas this is the array function MMult (MMult(x,S),Transpose(y)) . Portfolio Calculations Using Matrices—An Example We implement the above formulas in a numerical example. Suppose that there are four risky assets which have the following expected returns and variance-covariance matrix: 5. Array functions are discussed in Chapter 34.

As we shall see in the next chapter, all portfolio problems of N assets ultimately boil down to the two-asset case. We can now calculate the standard deviation and return of combinations of portfolios x and y . Note that once we have calculated the means, variances, and the covariance of the returns of the two portfolios, the calculation of the mean and the variance of any portfolio is the same as for the two-asset case. 7 209 Portfolio Models—Introduction 1 2 34567 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 1718 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 2728293031 32 33343536 37 3839 40 41ABC D E F G Mean returns E(r) % 6 5 0 . 0 3 0 . 0 1 0 . 0 0 1 . 0 % 8 4 0 . 0 - 6 0 . 0 0 3 . 0 1 0 . 0 % 0 1 2 0 . 0 0 4 . 0 6 0 . 0 3 0 . 0 % 5 1 0 5 . 0 2 0 . 0 4 0 . 0 - 5 0 . 0 Portfolio x 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.10 Portfolio y 0.20 0.10 0.10 0.60 Portfolio x and y statistics: Mean, variance, covariance, correlation Mean, E(r x) 9.10% Mean, E(r y) 12.00% <-- {=MMULT(B9:E9,F3:F6)} Variance σx20.1216 Variance σy20.2034 Covariance(x,y) 0.0714 Correlation ρxy 0.4540 <-- =B14/SQRT(B13*E13) Calculating returns of combinations of Portfolio x and Portfolio y Proportion of x 0.3 Mean portfolio return, E(r p) 11.13% <-- =B18*B12+(1-B18)*E12 Portfolio variance σp20.1406 <-- =B18^2*B13+(1-B18)^2*E13+2*B18*(1-B18)*B14 Portfolio standard deviation σp 37.50% <-- =SQRT(B20) Table of returns (using Data Table) Proportion of xStandard deviation Mean 37.50% 11.13% -0.5 61.72% 13.45% -0.4 58.15% 13.16% -0.3 54.68% 12.87% -0.2 51.33% 12.58% -0.1 48.13% 12.29% 0.0 45.10% 12.00% 0.1 42.29% 11.71% 0.2 39.74% 11.42% 0.3 37.50% 11.13% 0.4 35.63% 10.84% 0.5 34.20% 10.55% 0.6 33.26% 10.26% 0.7 32.84% 9.97% 0.8 32.99% 9.68% 0.9 33.67% 9.39% 1.0 34.87% 9.10%Variance-covariance, SA FOUR-ASSET PORTFOLIO PROBLEM <-- {=MMULT(MMULT(B9:E9,A3: D6),TRANSPOSE(B9:E9))} 7%8%9%10%11%12%13%14% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% 55% 60% 65%Por/g414olio expected return E(rp) Por/g414olio standard devia/g415on σpPor/g414olio Means and Returns 210 Chapter 8 8.5 Envelope Portfolios An envelope portfolio is the portfolio of risky assets that gives the lowest vari- ance of return of all portfolios having the same expected return. An effi cient portfolio is the portfolio that gives the highest expected return of all portfolios having the same variance. Mathematically, we may defi ne an envelope port-folio as follows: For a given return μ = E ( r p ), an effi cient portfolio p = [ x 1 , x 2 , … , x N ] is one that solves min xx V a r r xr E r xiji j jp i ii ip i iσ μ∑ ∑ ∑ ∑= () == () =subject to 1 The envelope is the set of all envelope portfolios, and the effi cient frontier is the set of all effi cient portfolios. 8 As shown by Black (1972), the envelope is the set of all convex combinations of any two envelope portfolios. 9 This means that if x = [ x 1 , x 2 , … , x N ] and y = [ y 1 , y 2 , … , y N ] are envelope portfolios and if a is a constant, then the portfolio Z defi ned by za x a yax a y ax a y ax a yNN=+ − =+− +− +−⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥()() () ()11 1 111 22 /vertellipsis is also an envelope portfolio. Thus, we can compute the whole envelope fron- tier if we can fi nd any two envelope portfolios. 8. Chapter 9 discusses the difference between envelope and effi cient portfolios. In a word: The effi cient frontier is a subset of the envelope containing only the optimal portfolios. 9. We discuss Black ’ s theorem more extensively in the next chapter. 211 Portfolio Models—Introduction By this theorem, once we have found two effi cient portfolios x and y , we know that any other effi cient portfolio is a convex combination of x and y .

Portfolios x and y Are Not on the Envelope To show that the concepts of envelope and effi cient portfolio is non-trivial, we show that the two portfolios whose combinations are graphed in the previous example are not either envelope or effi cient. This is easy to see if we extend the data table to include numbers for the individual stocks: 212 Chapter 8 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 28 29 3031 32 33 34 3536 37 38 39 4041 42 4344 45 46 47 4849G F E D C B A Mean returns E(r) % 6 5 0 . 0 3 0 . 0 1 0 . 0 0 1 . 0 % 8 4 0 . 0 - 6 0 . 0 0 3 . 0 1 0 . 0 % 0 1 2 0 . 0 0 4 . 0 6 0 . 0 3 0 . 0 % 5 1 0 5 . 0 2 0 . 0 4 0 . 0 - 5 0 . 0 Portfolio x 0.20 0.30 0.40 0.10 Portfolio y 0.20 0.10 0.10 0.60 Portfolio x and y statistics: Mean, variance, covariance, correlation Mean, E(rx) 9.10% Mean, E(ry) 12.00% <-- {=MMULT(B9:E9,F3:F6)} Variance σx20.1216 Variance σy20.2034 Covariance(x,y) 0.0714 Correlation ρxy 0.4540 <-- =B14/SQRT(B13*E13) Calculating returns of combinations of Portfolio x and Portfolio y Proportion of x 0.3 Mean portfolio return, E(rp) 11.13% <-- =B18*B12+(1-B18)*E12 Portfolio variance σp20.1406 <-- =B18^2*B13+(1-B18)^2*E13+2*B18*(1-B18)*B14 Portfolio standard deviation σp 37.50% <-- =SQRT(B20) Table of returns (using Data Table) Proportion of xStandard deviation Mean 37.50% 11.13% -1.0 80.60% 14.90% -0.8 72.88% 14.32% -0.6 65.38% 13.74% -0.4 58.15% 13.16% -0.2 51.33% 12.58% 0.0 45.10% 12.00% 0.2 39.74% 11.42% 0.4 35.63% 10.84% 0.6 33.26% 10.26% 0.8 32.99% 9.68% 1.0 34.87% 9.10% 1.2 38.60% 8.52% 1.4 43.69% 7.94% 1.6 49.74% 7.36% 1.8 56.44% 6.78% 2.0 63.58% 6.20% 2.2 71.02% 5.62% 2.4 78.69% 5.04% 2.6 86.53% 4.46% 2.7 90.49% 4.17% % 0 0 . 6 % 2 6 . 1 3 1 k c o t S % 0 0 . 8 % 7 7 . 4 5 2 k c o t S % 0 0 . 0 1 % 5 2 . 3 6 3 k c o t S % 0 0 . 5 1 % 1 7 . 0 7 4 k c o t SA FOUR-ASSET PORTFOLIO PROBLEM Variance-covariance, S <-- {=MMULT(MMULT(B9:E9,A3:D6),TRANSPOSE(B9:E 9))} 5%7%9%11%13%15%17% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% 55% 60% 65% 70% 75% 80% 85%Porƞolio expected return E(rp) Porƞolio standard devia Ɵon σpPorƞolio Means and Returns Stock 1Stock 2Stock 3Stock 4 213 Portfolio Models—Introduction Were the two portfolios on the envelope, then all of the individual stocks would fall on or inside the curved line in the graph. In our case, two of the stock returns (stock 1 and stock 4) fall outside the frontier created by combina-tions of portfolios x and y . Thus x and y cannot be effi cient portfolios. In Chapter 9 you will learn to compute effi cient and envelope portfolios, and as you will see there, this requires considerably more computation. 8.6 Summary In this chapter we have reviewed the basic concepts and mathematics of portfolios. In succeeding chapters we shall describe how to compute the variance-covariance matrix from asset returns and how to calculate effi cient portfolios. Exercises 1.

Appendix 8.1: Adjusting for Dividends When downloading data from Yahoo or other sources, the “adjusted price” includes an adjustment for dividends. In this appendix we discuss two ways of making this adjustment. 10 The fi rst, and simplest, method of adjusting for dividends is to add them to the annual change in price. In the following 10. It might be argued that since the free sources available on the web make these adjustments automatically, the details in this appendix are superfl uous. Nevertheless we think they offer some interesting insights. (If you disagree, turn the page!) 216 Chapter 8 example, if you purchased GM stock at the 1986 year-end price of $33 per share and held it for 1 year, you would, at the end of the year, have made 0.57%.

If the 1987 dividend is turned into shares at the end-1987 price, we can use it to buy 0.081 additional shares: New shares purchased at end -198725 0 30 690 081 ==. .. Thus we start 1988 with 1.081 shares. Since the 1988 dividend per share is $2.50, the total dividend received on the shares is 1.081*$2.50 = $2.704. Reinvesting these dividends in shares gives New shares purchased at end -19882 704 41 750 065 ==. .. Thus, at the end of 1988, the holder of GM shares will have accumulated 1 + 0.081 + 0.065 = 1.146 shares. As the spreadsheet fragment above shows, this reinvestment of dividends will produce a holding of 1.596 shares at the end of 1996, worth $88.963.

Suppose that r 1 , r 2 , … , r 12 are the returns for 12 periods (a period could be a month or it could be a year), then the price of the stock at the end of the 12 periods will be: PP err r 12 012 1 2=+++… This representation of prices and returns allows us to assume that the average periodic return is r = ( r 1 + r 2 + … + r 12 )/12. Since we wish to assume that the return data for the 12 periods represent the distribution of the returns for the coming period, it follows that the continuously compounded return is the appropriate return measure, and not the discretely compounded return r t = ( P At − P A , t − 1 )/ P A , t − 1 . How Different Are Continuously Compounded and Discretely Compounded Returns? The continuously compounded return will always be smaller than the dis-cretely compounded return, but the difference is usually not large. The follow-ing table shows the differences for the example in section 8.2: 219 Portfolio Models—Introduction 1 2 3 4 56 59606162636465666768 69 7071AB C D E F G H DateAAPL priceContinuous returnDiscrete returnGoogle priceContinuous returnDiscrete return 1 1 . 0 8 5 4 0 . 2 2 1 7 0 - n u J - 1 2-Jul-07 131.76 7.66% 7.96% <-- =B5/B4-1 645.90 10.74% 11.34% 1-Aug-07 138.48 4.97% 5.10% 599.39 -7.47% -7.20% 3-Jan-12 456.48 11.97% 12.71% 522.70 2.46% 2.49% 1-Feb-12 542.44 17.25% 18.83% 497.91 -4.86% -4.74% 1-Mar-12 599.55 10.01% 10.53% 471.38 -5.48% -5.33% 2-Apr-12 583.98 -2.63% -2.60% 458.16 -2.84% -2.80% 1-May-12 577.73 -1.08% -1.07% 449.45 -1.92% -1.90% 1-Jun-12 584.00 1.08% 1.09% 501.50 10.96% 11.58% . 2 e g a r e v a y l h t n o M % 6 2 . 0 % 4 2 . 0 - % 4 2 . 3 % 1 6 Monthly standard deviati % 7 0 . 0 1 % 9 0 . 0 1 % 9 6 . 0 1 % 7 1 . 1 1 n o % 1 9 . 2 - % 1 3 . 1 3 e g a r e v a l a u n n A % 5 0 . 1 2 1 % 4 0 . 4 3 1 e c n a i r a v l a u n n A % 2 0 . 0 1 1 % 8 7 . 5 1 1 n o i t a i v e d d r a d n a t s l a u n n A =SQRT(G70) -->APPLE AND GOOGLE COMPARING CONTINUOUS AND DISCRETE RETURNS =AVERAGE(G5:G64) --> =STDEV.S(G5:G64) --> =12*G66 -->=12*G67 --> Calculating Annual Returns and Variances from Periodic Returns Suppose we calculate a series of continuously compounded monthly rates of return r 1 , r 2 , … , r n and we wish to then calculate the mean and the variance of the annual rate of return. Clearly the mean annual return is given by: Mean annual returnnrt tn =⎡ ⎣⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ =∑ 121 1 To calculate the variance of the annual rate of return, we assume that the monthly rates of return are independent identically distributed random vari-ables.

Thus the computation of the variance and the standard deviation are simpler when using continuous compounding. 9 Calculating Effi cient Portfolios 9.1 Overview This chapter covers the theory and calculations necessary for both versions of the classical capital asset pricing model (CAPM)—both that which is based on a risk-free asset (also known as the Sharp-Lintner-Mossin model) and Black ’ s (1972) zero-beta CAPM (which does not require the assumption of a risk-free asset). You will fi nd that using a spreadsheet enables you to do the necessary calculations easily. The structure of the chapter is as follows: We begin with some preliminary defi nitions and notation. We then state the major results (proofs are given in the appendix to the chapter). In succeeding sections we implement these results, showing you: • How to calculate effi cient portfolios. • How to calculate the effi cient frontier. This chapter includes more theoretical material than most chapters in this book: Section 9.2 contains the propositions on portfolios which underlie the calculations of both effi cient portfolios and the security market line (SML) in Chapter 11. If you fi nd the theoretical material in section 9.2 diffi cult, skip it at fi rst and try to follow the illustrative calculations in section 9.3. This chapter assumes that the variance-covariance matrix is given; we delay a dis-cussion of various methods of computing the variance-covariance matrix until Chapter 10. 9.2 Some Preliminary Defi nitions and Notation Throughout this chapter we use the following notation: There are N risky assets, each of which has expected return E ( r i ). The matrix E ( r ) is the column vector of expected returns of these assets: ErEr Er Er N()=⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥() () ()1 2 /vertellipsis 222 Chapter 9 and S is the N × N variance-covariance matrix: SN N NN N N=⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥σσ σ σσ σ σσ σ11 21 1 12 22 2 12/midhorizellipsis /midhorizellipsis /vertellipsis /midhorizellipsis A portfolio of risky assets (when our intention is clear, we shall just use the word portfolio ) is a column vector x whose coordinates sum to 1: xx x xx Ni iN =⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥= =∑1 2 11/vertellipsis, Each coordinate x i represents the proportion of the portfolio invested in risky asset i . The expected portfolio return E ( r x ) of a portfolio x is given by the product of x and R : Er x R x Er xT ii iN ()=⋅ ≡ () =∑ 1. The variance of portfolio x ’ s return , σσxx x2≡ , is given by the product xS x x xT iji j jN iN = = =∑ ∑ σ 1 1 . The covariance between the return of two portfolios x and y , Cov ( r x ,ry ), is defi ned by the product σσxyT iji j jN iN xS y x y== = =∑ ∑ 1 1 . Note that σ xy = σ yx . The following graph illustrates four concepts. A feasible portfolio is any portfolio whose proportions sum to 1. The feasible set is the set of portfolio means and standard deviations generated by the feasible portfolios; this fea- sible set is the area inside and to the right of the curved line. A feasible port-folio is on the envelope of the feasible set if for a given mean return it has minimum variance. Finally, a portfolio x is an effi cient portfolio if it maximizes the return given the portfolio variance (or standard deviation). That is: x is effi cient if there is no other portfolio y such that E ( R y ) > E ( R x ) and σ y < σ x . The set of all effi cient portfolios is called the effi cient frontier ; this frontier is the heavier line in the graph. 223 Calculating Effi cient Portfolios 9.3 Five Propositions on Effi cient Portfolios and the CAPM In the appendix to this chapter we prove the following results, which are basic to the calculations of the CAPM. All of these propositions are used in deriving the effi cient frontier and the security market line; numerical illustrations are given in the next section and in succeeding chapters. P ROPOSITION 1 Let c be a constant. We use the notation E ( r ) − c to denote the following column vector: Er cEr c Er c Er c N()−=()− ()− ()−⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥1 2 /vertellipsis Let the vector z solve the system of simultaneous linear equations E ( r ) – c = Sz . Then this solution produces a portfolio x on the envelope of the feasible set in the following manner: 224 Chapter 9 zS E r c xx x xz zN ii j jN= ()− {} ={} =− =∑1 1 1,, ,… where Furthermore, all envelope portfolios are of this form. Intuition A formal proof of the proposition is given in the appendix to this chapter, but the intuition is simple and geometric. Suppose we pick a constant c and we try to fi nd an effi cient portfolio x for which there is a tangency between c and the feasible set: Finding Envelope Portfolios Portfolio standard deviationPortfolio mean return cx, the tangency portfolio given c Proposition 1 gives a procedure for fi nding x ; furthermore, the proposition states that all envelope portfolios (in particular, all effi cient portfolios) are the result of the procedure outlined in the proposition. That is, if x is any envelope portfolio, then there exists a constant c and a vector z such that Sz = E ( r ) – c and xz z i i=∑ . P ROPOSITION 2 By a theorem fi rst proved by Black (1972), any two envelope portfolios are enough to establish the whole envelope. Given any two envelope portfolios x = { x 1 , … , x N } and y = { y 1 , … , y N }, all envelope portfolios are 225 Calculating Effi cient Portfolios convex combinations of x and y . This means that given any constant a , the portfolio ax a yax a y ax a y ax a y NN+− =+− +− +−⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥()() () ()11 1 111 22 /vertellipsis is an envelope portfolio. P ROPOSITION 3 If y is any envelope portfolio, then for any other portfolio (envelope or not) x , we have the relationship: Er c Er c Cov x yxx y x y()=+ ()− [] =β βσwhere (, ) 2 Furthermore, c is the expected return of all portfolios z whose covariance with y is zero: cE r C o v y z z =() ( ) = ,,where 0 Notes If y is on the envelope, the regression of any and all portfolios x on y gives a linear relationship. In this version of the CAPM (usually known as “Black ’ s zero-beta CAPM,” in honor of Fischer Black, whose 1972 paper proved this result) the Sharpe-Lintner-Mossin security market line (SML) is replaced with an SML in which the role of the risk-free asset is played by a portfolio with a zero beta with respect to the particular envelope portfolio y . Note that this result is true for any envelope portfolio y . The converse of Proposition 3 is also true: P ROPOSITION 4 Suppose that there exists a portfolio y such that for any port- folio x the following relation holds: Er c Er c Cov x yxx y x y()=+ ()− [] =β βσwhere (, ) 2 226 Chapter 9 Then the portfolio y is an envelope portfolio. Propositions 3 and 4 show that an SML relation holds if and only if we regress all portfolio returns on an envelope portfolio with an R 2 = 100%. As Roll (1977, 1978) has forcefully pointed out, these propositions show that it is not enough to run a test of the CAPM by showing that the SML holds. 1 The only real test of the CAPM is whether the true market portfolio is mean- variance effi cient . We shall return to this topic in Chapter 10. T HE MARKET PORTFOLIO The market portfolio M is a portfolio composed of all the risky assets in the economy , with each asset taken in proportion to its value. To make this more specifi c: Suppose that there are N risky assets and that the market value of asset i is V i . Then the market portfolio has the follow- ing weights: Proportion of asset i in MV Vi h hN= =∑ 1 If the market portfolio M is effi cient (this is a big “if” as we shall see in Chapters 11 and 13, Proposition 3 is also true for the market portfolio. That is, the SML holds with E ( r z ) substituted for c : Er Er Er Er Cov x MCov z Mxz x M z x M()=+ ()− [] =()() =() () ,,β βσwhere and20 0 This version of the SML has received the most empirical attention of all of the CAPM results. In Chapter 11 we show how to calculate β and how to calculate the SML; we go on to examine Roll ’ s criticism of these empirical tests. From the following graph, it is easy to see how to locate a zero-beta portfolio on the envelope of the feasible set: 1. Roll ’ s 1977 paper is more often cited and more comprehensive, but his 1978 paper is much easier to read and intuitive. If you ’ re interested in this literature, start there. 227 Calculating Effi cient Portfolios When there is a risk-free asset, Proposition 3 specializes to the security market line of the classic capital asset pricing model: P ROPOSITION 5 If there exists a risk-free asset with return r f , then there exists an envelope portfolio M such that: Er r Er r Cov x Mxf x M f x M()=+ ()− [] =β βσwhere (, ) 2 As shown in the classic papers by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), and Mossin (1966), if all investors choose their portfolios only on the basis of portfolio mean and standard deviation, then the portfolio x of Proposition 5 is the market portfolio M . In the remainder of this chapter, we explore the meaning of these proposi- tions using numerical examples worked out on Excel. 9.4 Calculating the Effi cient Frontier: An Example In this section we calculate the effi cient frontier using Excel. We consider a world with four risky assets having the following expected returns and vari-ance-covariance matrix: Finding Envelope Portfolios Portfolio standard deviationPortfolio mean return cx, the tangency portfolio given c Zero-beta portfolios alon g this line 228 Chapter 9 Each cell of the column vector labeled E(r) minus constant contains the mean return of the given asset minus the value of the constant c (in this case c = 4%). We use this column in fi nding the second envelope portfolio below. We separate our calculations into two parts: In the next subsection we cal- culate two portfolios on the envelope of the feasible set. In the subsequent subsection we calculate the effi cient frontier. Calculating Two Envelope Portfolios By Proposition 2, we have to fi nd two effi cient portfolios in order to identify the whole effi cient frontier. By Proposition 1 each envelope portfolio solves the system R − c = Sz for z . To identify two effi cient portfolios, we use two different values for c . For each value of c , we solve for z and then set xz zii h h=∑ to fi nd an effi cient portfolio. The c ’ s we solve for are arbitrary (see section 9.6), but to make life easy, we fi rst solve this system for c = 0. This gives the following results: 1 2 34 5 678AB C D E F G H Mean returns E(r)E(r) minus constant 0.10 0.01 0.03 0.05 6% 2.00% <-- =F3-$B$8 0.01 0.30 0.06 -0.04 8% 4.00% 0.03 0.06 0.40 0.02 10% 6.00% 0.05 -0.04 0.02 0.50 15% 11.00% Constant, c 4.00%CALCULATING THE FRONTIER Variance-covariance, S 10 11 1213 14 15 16AB C D E F G H Computing an envelope portfolio with constant = 0 zEnvelope portfolio x 0.3861 <-- {=MMULT(MINVERSE(A3:D6),F3:F6)} 0.3553 <-- =A12/SUM($A$12:$A$15) 2 6 3 2 . 0 7 6 5 2 . 0 3 5 5 1 . 0 8 8 6 1 . 0 2 3 5 2 . 0 2 5 7 2 . 0 Sum 1.0000 <-- =SUM(F12:F15) 229 Calculating Effi cient Portfolios The formulas in the cells are: • F o r z we use the array function MMult(MInverse(A3:D6),F3:F6) . The range A3:D6 contains the variance-covariance matrix and the cells F3:F6 contain the expected returns of the assets. • F o r x : Each cell contains the associated value of z divided by the sum of all the z ’ s. Thus, for example, cell F12 contains the formula = A12/SUM($A$12:$A$15) . To fi nd the second envelope portfolio we now solve this system for c = 0.04 (cell B8). 18 19 2021222324AB C D E F G H Computing an envelope portfolio with constant = 4.00% zEnvelope portfolio y 0.0404 <-- {=MMULT(MINVERSE(A3:D6),G3:G6)} 0.0782 <-- =A20/SUM($A$20:$A$23)0.1386 0.2684 0.1151 0.2227 0.2224 0.4307 Sum 1.0000 <-- =SUM(F20:F23) The portfolio y in cells F20:F23 is, by the results of Proposition 1, an enve- lope portfolio. This vector z associated with y is calculated in a manner similar to that of the fi rst vector, except that the array function in the cells is MMult(MInverse(A3:D6),G3:G6) , where G3:G6 contains the vector of expected returns minus the constant 0.04.

This now enables us to calculate the mean, variance, and covariance as follows: E(x) uses the array formula MMult(transpose_x,means) . Note that we could have also used the function SumProduct(x,means) . Var(x) uses the array formula MMult(MMult(transpose_x, var_cov),x) . Sigma(x) uses the formula Sqrt(var_x) . Cov(x,y) uses the array formula MMult(MMult(transpose_x,var_ cov),y) . Corr(x,y) uses the formula cov(x,y)/(sigma_x*sigma_y) .

Also marked are other portfolios, some of which contain short positions of either x or y . Note that the convex combinations all lie on the envelope, but may not necessarily be effi cient. An example is the last point in the data table—300% in x and − 200% in portfolio y . Thus, while every effi cient portfolio is a convex combination of any two effi cient portfolios, it is not true that every convex combination of any two effi cient portfolios is effi cient. 234 Chapter 9 1 2 3456789 101112131415 1617AB C D E F G Mean returns E(r) 0.10 0.01 0.03 0.05 6% 0.01 0.30 0.06 -0.04 8% 0.03 0.06 0.40 0.02 10% 0.05 -0.04 0.02 0.50 15% Constant 4% Envelope portfolio 0.0782 0.26840.22270.4307 Portfolio mean 11.30% <-- =SUMPRODUCT(A11:A14,F3:F6) Portfolio sigma 37.60% <-- {=SQRT(MMULT(MMULT(TRANSPOSE(A11:A14),A3:D6),A11:A14))}Variance-covariance, S FINDING ENVELOPE PORT FOLIOS IN ONE STEP <-- {=MMULT(MINVERSE(A3:D6),F3:F6- B8)/SUM(MMULT(MINVERSE(A3:D6),F3:F6-B8))} 9.5 Finding Effi cient Portfolios in One Step The examples in section 9.4 fi nd effi cient portfolios by writing out most of the components of the portfolio separately on the spreadsheet. However, for some uses we will want to calculate the effi cient portfolio in one step. Here ’ s an example: This approach requires a number of Excel tricks, most of which relate to the correct use of array functions. The end result is that we can write the Proposition 1 expression for an envelope portfolio, xSE rc Sum S E r c=()− {} ()− {}[]− −1 1 , in one cell: • In cells A11:A14 we have used the array formula F3:F6-B8 to indicate the expected returns minus the constant in cell B8. • In these same cells we have used SUM(MMult(MInverse(A3:D6),F3:F6- B8)) to give the denominator of the expression xSE rc Sum S E r c=()− {} ()− {}[]− −1 1 . 235 Calculating Effi cient Portfolios Using Cell Names for Clarity We can make the whole process even clearer by using cell names. To defi ne a cell name, simply mark the cell or a range of cells and go to the Name Box , as shown below: You can now go into the box and type a name: 236 Chapter 9 9.6 Three Notes on the Optimization Procedure In this section we note three additional facts about the optimization procedure of Proposition 1, which leads to the computation of envelope portfolios. Note 1: All Roads Lead to Rome: Envelope Is Determined by Any Two c ’ s By Proposition 2, the envelope is determined by any two of its portfolios. This means that for the determination of the envelope it is irrelevant which two portfolios we use. To drive home this point, the spreadsheet below computes three envelope portfolios: • The envelope portfolio x is computed with a constant c = 0%. • The envelope portfolio y is computed with a constant c = 4%. • A third envelope portfolio z is computed with a constant c = 6% (cells D11:D14). As shown in rows 20–26, portfolio z is composed of a convex combination of x and y . This is true for any x , y , and z . This little exercise shows that the constants c which determine the enve- lope are completely arbitrary. Any two constants will determine the same envelope.

Let M be the effi cient portfolio which is the solution to the system of equations: 240 Chapter 9 Er r S z Mz zf ii i iN()−= = =∑ 1 Now consider a convex combination of the portfolio M and the risk-free asset r f ; for example, suppose that the weight of the risk-free asset in such a portfolio is a .

It is graphed below along with the effi cient frontier: Efficient Frontier with CML Portfolio standard deviationPortfolio mean returnMarket portfolio, MCapital market line, CML Risk-free rate, r f The portfolio M is called the market portfolio for several reasons: • Suppose investors agree about the statistical portfolio information (i.e., the vector of expected returns E ( r ) and the variance-covariance matrix S ). Suppose furthermore that investors are interested only in maximizing expected portfolio 241 Calculating Effi cient Portfolios return given portfolio standard deviation σ . Then it follows that all optimal portfolios will lie on the CML . • In the case above, it further follows that the portfolio M is the only portfolio of risky assets included in any optimal portfolio . M must therefore include all the risky assets, with each asset weighted in proportion to its market value . That is: weight of risky asset i in portfolio MV V where V is the markei i iN i= =∑ 1 tt value of asset i It is not diffi cult to fi nd M when we know r f : We merely have to solve for the effi cient portfolio given that the constant c = r f . When r f changes, we get a different “market” portfolio—this is just the effi cient portfolio given a con-stant of r f . For example, in our numerical example, suppose that the risk-free rate is r f = 5%.

To drive home the point that this technique always works, we show you all the calculations using a different value for c (cell B21, highlighted below).

Two basic propositions allow us to derive portfolios on the envelope of the feasible set of portfolios and the envelope itself. Three further propositions relate the expected returns of any asset or portfolio to the expected returns on any effi cient portfolio. Under certain circumstances, this allows us to derive the security market line (SML) and the capital market line (CML) of the classic capital asset pricing model (CAPM). In subsequent chapters we discuss the implementation of the CAPM. We show how to compute the variance-covariance matrix (Chapter 10), how to test the SML (Chapter 11), how to optimize in the presence of short-sale constraints (Chapter 12), and how to derive useful portfolio optimization 246 Chapter 9 routines from our knowledge of effi cient set mathematics (Chapter 13, which discusses the Black-Litterman model).

Use these two portfolios to generate an effi cient frontier for the six furniture companies. Plot this frontier. d. Is there an effi cient portfolio with only positive proportions of all the assets? 2. A suffi cient condition to produce positively weighted effi cient portfolios is that the vari- ance-covariance matrix be diagonal: That is, that σ ij = 0, for i ≠ j . By continuity, positively weighted portfolios will result if the off-diagonal elements of the variance- covariance matrix are suffi ciently small compared to the diagonal. Consider a transforma-tion of the above matrix in which: σεσ σijijoriginal iioriginalij=≠ ⎧ ⎨⎩if When ε = 1, this transformation will give the original variance-covariance matrix and when ε = 0, the transformation will give a fully diagonal matrix. For r = 10% fi nd the maximum ε for which all portfolio weights are positive. 3.

As in the chapter, we assume that we are examining data for N risky assets. It is important to note that all the defi ni- tions of “feasibility” and “optimality” are made relative to this set. Thus the phrase “effi cient” really means “effi cient relative to the set of the N assets being examined.” p roposition 0 The set of all feasible portfolios of risky assets is convex. Proof A portfolio x is feasible if and only if the proportions of the portfolio add up to 1; i.e., xi iN =∑ = 11 , where N is the number of risky assets. Suppose that x and y are feasible portfolios and suppose that λ is some number between 0 and 1. Then it is clear that z = λ x + (1 − λ ) y is also feasible. proposition 1 Let c be a constant and denote by R the vector of mean returns. A portfolio x is on the envelope relative to the sample set of N assets if and only if it is the normalized solu- tion of the system: Rc S z xz zii h h−= =∑ Proof A portfolio x is on the envelope of the feasible set of portfolios if and only if it lies on the tangency of a line connecting some point c on the y -axis to the feasible set. Such a portfolio must either maximize or minimize the ratio xR c x−() σ2() , where x ( R − c ) is the vector product which gives the portfolio ’ s expected excess return over c , and σ 2 ( x ) is the portfolio ’ s variance. Let this ratio ’ s value, when maximized (or minimized), be λ . Then our portfolio must satisfy xR c x x R c x xSxT−()= ⇒−() ==σλ σλ λ2 2() () Let h be a particular asset and differentiate this last expression with respect to x h . This gives: Rc S xhT−= λ . Writing z h = λ x h , we see that a portfolio is effi cient if and only if it solves the system R − c = Sz . Normalizing z so that its coordinates add to 1 gives the desired result. proposition 2 The convex combination of any two envelope portfolios is on the envelope of the feasible set. Proof Let x and y be portfolios on the envelope. By the above theorem, it follows that there exist two vectors, z x and z y , and two constants c x and c y , such that: • x is the normalized-to-unity vector of z x ; i.e., xz zixi xh h=∑ , and y is the normalized-to-unity vector of z y . • R − c x = Sz x and R − c y = Sz y 249 Calculating Effi cient Portfolios Furthermore, since z maximizes the ratio zR c z−() σ2() , it follows that any normalization of z also maximizes this ratio. With no loss in generality, therefore, we can assume that z sums to 1. It follows that for any real number a the portfolio az x + (1 − a ) z y solves the system R − ( ac x + (1 − a ) c y ) = Sz . This proves our claim. proposition 3 Let y be any envelope portfolio of the set of N assets. Then for any other portfolio x (including, possibly, a portfolio composed of a single asset) there exists a constant c such that the following relation holds between the expected return on x and the expected return on portfolio y : Er c Er c Cov x yxx y x y()=+ ()− [] =β βσwhere (, ) 2 Furthermore, c = E ( r z ), where z is any portfolio for which Cov ( z,y ) = 0. Proof Let y be a particular envelope portfolio and let x be any other portfolio. We assume that both portfolios x and y are column vectors. Note that βσx yT TCov x y x Sy yS y==(, ) 2 Now since y is on the envelope, we know that there exist a vector w and a constant c which solves the system Sw = R − c and that yw w w a i i==∑ / . Substituting this in the expression for β x , we get: βσx yT TT TT TCov x y x Sy yS yxR c a yRc axRc yRc== =− −=− −(,) ( ) ()() ()2 Next note that since xi i∑ =1 , it follows that x T I ( R − c ) = E ( r x ) − c and that y T I ( R − c ) = E ( r y ) − c . This shows that βxx yEr c Er c=()− ()− which can be rewritten as: Er c Er c xx y()=+ ()− []β To fi nish the proof, let z be a portfolio which has zero covariance with y . Then the above logic shows that c = E ( r z ). This proves the claim. proposition 4 If in addition to the N risky assets, there exists a risk-free asset with return r f , then the standard security market line holds: Er r Er r Cov x Mxfx M f x M()=+ ()− [] =β βσ, (, )where 2 250 Chapter 9 Proof If there exists a risk-free security, then the tangent line from this security to the effi cient frontier dominates all other feasible portfolios. Call the point of tangency on the effi cient frontier M ; then the result follows. Note : It is important to repeat again that the terminology “Market portfolio” refers in this case to the “Market portfolio relative to the sample set of N assets.” proposition 5 Suppose that there exists a portfolio y such that for any portfolio x the fol- lowing relation holds: Er c Er c Cov x yxx y x y()=+ ()− [] =β βσwhere (, ) 2 Then the portfolio y is on the envelope. Proof Substituting in for the defi nition of β x it follows that for any portfolio x the following relation holds: xS y xR c yR cT yT Tσ2=− − Let x be the vector composed solely of the fi rst risky asset: x = {1, 0, … , 0}. Then the above equation becomes: SyyR cEr c Sa y E r cT y121 11−=()− =()−σ which we write: where S 1 is the fi rst row of the variance-covariance matrix S . Note that ayR cT y=− σ2 is a constant whose value is independent of the vector x . If we let x be a vector composed solely of the i th risky asset, we get: Sa y E r cii=()− This proves that the vector z = ay solves the system Sz = R − c ; by Proposition 1 this means that the normalization of z is on the envelope. But this normalization is simply the vector y . 1 0 Calculating the Variance-Covariance Matrix 10.1 Overview In order to calculate effi cient portfolios, we must be able to compute the variance-covariance matrix from return data for stocks. In this chapter we discuss this computation, showing how to do the calculations in Excel. The most obvious calculation is the sample variance-covariance matrix : This is the matrix computed directly from the historic returns. We illustrate several methods for calculating the sample variance-covariance matrix, including a direct calculation in the spreadsheet using the excess return matrix and an implementation of this method with VBA. While the sample variance-covariance matrix may appear to be an obvious choice, a large literature recognizes that it may not be the best estimate of variances and covariances. Disappointment with the sample variance-covariance matrix stems both from its often unrealistic parameters and from its inability to predict. These issues are discussed briefl y in sections 10.5 and 10.6. As an alternative to the sample matrix, sections 10.7–10.10 discuss so-called “shrinkage” methods for improving the estimate of the variance-covariance matrix. 1 Before starting this chapter, you may want to peruse Chapter 34 which discusses array functions . These are Excel functions whose arguments are vectors and matrices; their implementation is slightly different from standard Excel functions. This chapter makes heavy use of the array functions Trans- pose( ) and MMult( ) as well as some other “home-grown” array functions. 10.2 Computing the Sample Variance-Covariance Matrix Suppose we have return data for N assets over M periods. Writing the return of asset i in period t as r it , we write the mean return of asset i as: rMri N ii t tM == … =∑11 1,, , Then the covariance of the return of asset i and asset j is calculated as: σij it i tM jt j Cov i jMrrrr i j N ==−−() ⋅−() =… =∑ (, ) , , , ,1 11 1 1. We return to the issue of prediction in Chapter 13, which discusses the Black-Litterman model of portfolio optimization. 252 Chapter 10 The matrix of these covariances (which includes, of course, the variances when i = j ) is the sample variance-covariance matrix . Our problem is to calculate these covariances effi ciently. Defi ne the excess return matrix to be: A matrix of excess ret urnsrr r r rr r r rrNN NN M==−− −− −11 1 1 12 1 2 11/midhorizellipsis /midhorizellipsis /vertellipsis/vertellipsis /midhorizellipsis /midhorizellipsis rrNM N−⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥ Columns of matrix A subtract the mean asset return from the individual asset returns.

We don ’ t think this matters very much, but for reference to a higher authority, we suggest our discussion of M versus M – 1 in section 8.2. Starting with Excel 2010, Microsoft has cleared up considerable confusion that once existed in Excel about whether to divide by M or M – 1.

Both uses illustrate the problematics of working with sample data and provide us with the introduction needed for sections 10.7–10.10, which discuss alterna-tives to the sample variance-covariance matrix. In this section we discuss the GMPV . Suppose there are N assets having a variance-covariance matrix S . The GMVP is the portfolio x = { x 1 , x 2 , … , x N } which has the lowest variance from among all feasible portfolios.

We combine this in section 10.9 with the constant correlation method to compute a variance-covariance matrix. The fi rst three models arise out of a distrust of return data for generating the covariances of the data in the future. The fourth method—using option data—goes further and assumes that even the sample variances are an inac-curate prediction of future variance. 10.6 Alternatives to the Sample Variance-Covariance: The Single-Index Model (SIM) The single-index model (SIM) began as an attempt to simplify some of the computational complexities of calculating the variance-covariance matrix. 5 The basic assumption of the SIM is that the returns of each asset can be linearly regressed on a market index x : /tildenosp/tildenosp /tildenosp rr ii i x i=+ +αβ ε where the correlation between ε i and ε j is zero. Given this assumption, it is easy to establish the following two facts: • Er Er ii i x/tildenosp/tildenosp()=+ () αβ • σββσ σijijx iij ij=≠=⎧⎨⎩ 2 2when when 5. W. M.

In th e shrinkage var-cov this matrix is given weight 1-lambda. 268 Chapter 10 There is little theory about choosing the proper shrinkage estimator. 6 Our suggestion is to choose a shrinkage operator λ so that the GMVP is wholly positive (see next section for details). 10.9 Using Option Information to Compute the Variance Matrix 7 Another way to compute the variance matrix is to use the information from the options market. We use the implied volatility for each of the stocks from their at-the-money call options and then compute the variance matrix using constant correlation: σσ ρσ σiji implied i implied j impliedij ij==≠⎧ ⎨⎩ , ,,2if if Here ’ s an example for our 10-stock case. We use data from the options markets and the function CallVolatility discussed in Chapter 17 to compute the implied volatility for each of the 10 stocks and the S&P 500. We use our data set of fi ve years of returns to compute the historical volatility: 6.

This chapter gives fi ve alternatives to computing the variance-covariance matrix: • The sample variance-covariance • The single-index model • The constant correlation approach • Shrinkage methods • Implied volatility-based variance-covariance matrices How do we compare these alternatives? Which one should we choose? We could compare the technical outcomes of using each of these methods—for example, show the alternative values of the GMVP using different methods—but this largely misses the point. The choice of how to compute the variance-covariance matrix is largely a question of how you view capital markets. If you strongly believe that the past predicts the future, then perhaps your choice should be to use the sample varcov matrix. This author prefers to get away from history … our preference is to use an option-based volatility model with a changing correlation: In “normal” times we would use a “normal” correlation of between 0.2 and 0.3; in times of crisis, we would use a much higher correlation, say, ρ = 0.5 − 0.6. 272 Chapter 10 1 2 34 5 6789 10 11 1213141516AB C D E F G H La-Z-Boy Kimball FlexsteelLeggett & PlattHerman Mille rShaw Industries 1982 36.67% 0.20% 41.54% 21.92% 26.13% 22.50% 1983 122.82% 61.43% 195.09% 62.27% 73.38% 117.89% 1984 14.44% 63.51% -38.38% -1.27% 45.15% 7.80% 1985 21.39% 28.42% 1.30% 81.17% 24.27% 38.14% 1986 45.36% -7.44% 21.89% 19.83% 10.73% 54.48% 1987 20.19% 48.27% 9.11% -10.21% -11.92% 26.82% 1988 -8.94% -11.28% 12.65% 13.77% 7.06% -6.24% 1989 27.02% 12.85% 12.08% 32.55% -7.55% 123.03% 1990 -11.64% 2.42% -17.13% -6.48% 1.31% 15.48% 1991 20.29% 6.90% 3.62% 50.12% -5.54% 19.92% 1992 34.08% 22.21% 33.46% 84.40% 5.71% 62.76% Beta 0.80 0.95 0.65 0.85 0.85 1.40 Mean returns 29.24% 20.68% 25.02% 31.64% 15.34% 43.87% <-- =AVERAGE(G3:G13)DATA FOR 6 FURNITURE COMPANIES 10.11 Summary In this chapter we considered how to compute the variance-covariance matrix which is central to all portfolio optimization. Starting with the standard sample variance-covariance matrix, we also showed how to compute several alterna-tives that have appeared in the literature as perhaps improving portfolio computations. Exercises 1. Below you will fi nd annual return data for six furniture companies for the years 1982– 1992. Use these data to calculate the variance-covariance matrix of the returns. The remaining exercises refer to the data in the tab Price data on the exercise spreadsheet that accompanies this book. This tab gives three years of price data for six stocks and the S&P 500 as a surrogate for the market. 2. Compute the returns of the data and the statistics for each of the assets (mean return, variance and standard deviation of return, beta). 3. Compute the sample variance-covariance matrix and the correlation matrix for the six stocks. 4. Use the function SIM defi ned in the chapter to compute the single-index variance-cova- riance matrix. 5. Compute the global minimum variance portfolio (GMVP) using the sample variance- covariance matrix. 6. Compute the GMVP using the constant correlation covariance matrix. 1 1 Estimating Betas and the Security Market Line 11.1 Overview The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is one of the two most influential innovations in financial theory in the latter half of the twentieth century. 1 By integrating the portfolio decision with utility theory and the statistical behavior of asset prices, the formulators of the CAPM defined the paradigm which is now generally used for the analysis of stock prices. What does the CAPM actually say? What are its empirical implications? Roughly speaking, we can differentiate between two kinds of implications of the CAPM. First, the capital market line (CML) defines the individual optimal portfolios for an investor interested in the mean and variance of her optimal portfolio. Second, given agreement between investors on the statistical proper-ties of asset returns and on the importance of mean-variance optimization, the security market line (SML) defines the risk-return relation for each individual asset . It is useful to differentiate between the case wherein a risk-free asset exists and the case wherein there is no risk-free asset. 2 Case 1: A Risk-Free Asset Exists Suppose a risk-free asset exists and has return r f . We can differentiate between the individual optimization of investors and the general equilibrium implica-tions of the CAPM: • Individual optimization: Assuming that investors optimize based on the expected return and standard deviation of their portfolio returns (in the jargon of finance—they have “mean-variance” preferences), the CAPM states that each individual investor ’ s optimal portfolio falls on the line Er r Er r pfp x f()=+ ()− []σ , where portfolio x is a portfolio which maximizes Er r yf y()− σ for all feasible portfolios y . Proposition 1 of Chapter 9 shows that x can be computed by xx x xSE r r SE r rNf f=…{} =()− [] ()− []− −∑121 1,, , , where 1. The other remarkable innovation is option pricing theory, which is discussed in Chapters 15–19. These two innovations together have accounted for a number of Nobel Prizes in Econom-ics: Harry Markowitz (1990), William Sharpe (1990), Myron Scholes (1997), and Robert Merton (1997). But for their untimely demise, others associated with these theories—Jan Mossin (1936–1987), and Fischer Black (1938–1995)—would doubtless also have received the Nobel. 2. The existence (or non-existence) of a risk-free asset is closely related to the investment horizon. Assets which are risk-free over a short term may not be riskless over a longer term. 274 Chapter 11 S is the variance-covariance matrix of risky asset returns and Er Er Er Er N ()= () () … () {} 12,, , is the vector of expected asset returns. • General equilibrium : If all investors agree about the statistical assumptions of the model—the variance-covariance matrix S and the vector of expected asset returns E ( r )—and if a risk-free asset exists, then individual asset returns are defined by the security market line (SML): Er rCov r rEr r ifiM MMf ()=+()()− [], σ2 where M denotes the market portfolio—the value-weighted portfolio of all risky assets. The expression Cov r r iM M,() σ2 is generally termed the asset ’ s beta : βσiiM MCov r r=(), 2 . Case 2: No Risk-Free Asset Exists If there is no risk-free asset, then the implications of the CAPM both for individual optimization and for general equilibrium are defined by Black ’ s (1972) zero-beta model (Proposition 3 of Chapter 9): • Individual optimization : In the absence of a risk-free asset, individual optimal portfolios will fall along the efficient frontier . As shown in Proposition 2 of Chapter 9, this frontier is the upward-sloping portion of the mean-sigma combinations created by the convex combination of any two optimizing portfolios xSE r c SE r c=()− [] ()− []− −∑1 1 1 1 and ySE r c SE r c=()− [] ()− []− −∑1 2 1 2 , where c 1 and c 2 are two arbitrary constants. • General equilibrium : In the absence of a risk-free asset, if all investors agree about the statistical assumptions of the model—the variance-covariance matrix S and the vector of expected asset returns E ( r )—then individual asset returns are defined by the security market line (SML): Er ErCov r rEr Er iziy yyz ()=()+()()−() [], σ2 where y is any efficient portfolio and z is a portfolio which has zero covariance with y (the so-called “zero beta portfolio”). 275 Estimating Betas and the Security Market Line The case of no risk-free asset is obviously weaker than the case of a risk- free asset. If there is a risk-free asset, the general equilibrium version of the CAPM says that all portfolios are situated on a single, agreed-upon line. If there is no risk-free asset, then all optimal portfolios are on the same frontier; but in this case asset betas can differ, since there are many portfolios y which fulfill the equation Er ErCov r rEr Er iziy yyz ()=()+()()−() [], σ2 . The CAPM as a Prescriptive and a Descriptive Tool As you can see from the discussion above, the CAPM is both prescriptive and descriptive . As a prescriptive tool, the CAPM tells a mean-variance investor how to choose his optimal portfolio. By finding a portfolio of the form SE r c SE r c− −()− [] ()− []∑1 1 1 1 , the investor can identify an optimal portfolio from the data set. As a descriptive tool, the CAPM gives conditions under which we can generalize about the structure of expected returns in the market. Whether or not a risk-free asset exists, these conditions assume that investors agree on the statistical structure of asset returns—the variance-covariance matrix and the expected returns. In this case all the returns are expected to lie on a security market line (SML) of the form Er rCov r rEr r ifiM MMf ()=+()()− [], σ2 (if there is a risk-free asset) or of the form Er ErCov r rEr Er iziy yyz ()=()+()()−() [], σ2 i f there is no risk-free asset. This Chapter In this chapter we look at some typical capital market data and replicate a simple test of the descriptive part of the CAPM. This means that we have to calculate the betas for a set of assets, and we then have to determine the equa-tion of the security market line (SML). The test in this chapter is the simplest possible test of the CAPM. There is an enormous literature in which the pos-sible statistical and methodological pitfalls of CAPM tests are discussed. Good 276 Chapter 11 places to begin are textbooks by Elton, Gruber, Brown, and Goetzmann (2009), and Bodie, Kane, and Marcus (2010). 3 11.2 Testing the SML Typical tests of the security market line (SML) start with return data on a set of risky assets. The steps in the test are as follows: • Determine a candidate for the market portfolio M . In our example we will use the Standard & Poor ’ s 500 Index (S&P 500) as a candidate for M . This is a critical step: In principle, the “true” market portfolio should—as pointed out in Chapter 9—contain all the market ’ s risky assets in proportion to their value. It is clearly impossible to calculate this theoretical market portfolio, and we must therefore make do with a surrogate. As you will see in the next two sections, the propositions of Chapter 9 can shed much light on how the choice of the market surrogate affects the r -squared of our regression test of the CAPM. • For each of the assets in question, determine the asset beta, βσiiM MCov r r=(), 2 . This is often called the first-pass regression . • Regress the mean returns of the assets on their respective betas (the second- pass regression ): rii=+γγ β01 If the CAPM in its descriptive format holds, then the second-pass regression should be the security market line. 4 We illustrate the tests of the CAPM with a simple numerical example that uses data for the 30 stocks in the Dow-Jones Industrials. We start with the prices of the S&P 500 (symbol ∧ GSPC) and the stocks in the DJ30 (some of the rows and columns are not shown): 3.

Our personal expositional favorite is a paper by Roll, “Ambiguity When Performance Is Measured by the Securities Market Line,” Journal of Finance (1978). 4. This is a direct consequence of Propositions 3 and 4 of Chapter 9. 277 Estimating Betas and the Security Market Line 1 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 51 5253 54 5556 57AB C D E F G HI J K L M N DateS&P500 Index ^GSPCAlcoa AAAmerican International Group AIGAmerican Express AXPBoeing BACitigroup CCaterpillar CATDuPont DDDisney DISGeneral Electric GEGeneral Motors GMHome Depot HDHoneywell HON 03-Jul-01 1211.23 35.37 81.32 33.73 53.64 40.97 24.73 36.29 25.02 38.33 49.72 48.26 32.75 01-Aug-01 1133.58 34.50 76.43 30.46 47.06 37.49 22.45 35.01 24.14 36.04 43.14 44.06 33.2704-Sep-01 1040.94 28.06 76.24 24.30 30.79 33.15 20.11 32.07 17.68 32.93 33.81 36.79 23.57 01-Oct-01 1059.78 29.34 76.82 24.68 29.97 37.26 20.23 34.18 17.65 32.23 32.56 36.66 26.38 01-Nov-01 1139.45 35.09 80.54 27.60 32.43 39.34 21.45 38.21 19.43 34.08 39.63 44.78 29.7703-Dec-01 1148.08 32.32 77.64 29.93 35.83 41.46 23.63 36.63 19.88 35.63 38.75 48.97 30.38 02-Jan-02 1130.20 32.59 72.51 30.13 37.83 39.06 22.91 38.06 20.21 33.03 40.77 48.09 30.19 01-Feb-02 1106.73 34.31 72.38 30.64 42.64 37.29 25.29 40.68 22.07 34.39 42.67 48.00 34.43 01-Jul-05 1234.18 27.48 59.76 47.68 65.02 42.62 53.28 41.22 25.37 33.53 34.89 42.97 38.43 01-Aug-05 1220.33 26.38 58.92 47.89 66.26 42.89 54.85 38.55 24.93 32.66 32.86 39.92 37.66 01-Sep-05 1228.81 24.05 61.67 49.79 67.18 44.60 58.07 38.16 23.88 32.94 29.42 37.76 36.89 03-Oct-05 1207.01 23.92 64.49 49.41 63.91 44.86 52.22 40.62 24.11 33.17 26.33 40.63 33.65 01-Nov-05 1249.48 27.16 66.82 51.04 67.67 48.04 57.37 42.02 24.67 34.94 21.44 41.46 36.1501-Dec-05 1248.29 29.30 67.91 51.08 69.71 48.02 57.36 41.77 23.97 34.53 19.01 40.17 36.85 03-Jan-06 1280.08 31.21 65.15 52.19 67.79 46.09 67.69 38.48 25.31 32.27 23.56 40.24 38.01PRICE DATA FOR THE DOW-JONES INDUSTRIAL STOCKS AND THE STANDARD AND POORS 500 July 2001 - July 2006 1 2 3 4 567 8 9 1011 12 1314 15 16AB C D E F G H I J K L M N DateS&P 500 Index ^GSPCAlcoa AAAmerican International Group AIGAmerican Express AXPBoeing BACitigroup CCaterpillar CATDuPont DDDisney DISGeneral Electric GEGeneral Motors GMHome Depot HDHoneywell HON Average return 0.07% -0.09% -0.54% 0.72% 0.67% 0.30% 1.79% 0.18% 0.29% -0.23% -0.87% -0.52% 0.29% Beta 1.00 1.90 0.99 1.38 1.15 1.30 1.39 1.00 1.28 0.84 1.41 1.55 1.66 % 7 1 . 0 % 3 6 . 0 - % 7 9 . 0 - % 0 3 . 0 - % 0 2 . 0 % 1 1 . 0 % 9 6 . 1 % 1 2 . 0 % 8 5 . 0 % 2 6 . 0 % 1 6 . 0 - % 3 2 . 0 - 0 a h p l A R-squared 1 0.6085 0.3518 0.7052 0.2487 0.5972 0.5158 0.4362 0.3845 0.3221 0.2607 0.5288 0.5473 01-Aug-01 -6.63% -2.49% -6.20% -10.20% -13.09% -8.88% -9.67% -3.59% -3.58% -6.16% -14.20% -9.11% 1.58% 04-Sep-01 -8.53% -20.66% -0.25% -22.59% -42.42% -12.30% -11.01% -8.77% -31.14% -9.02% -24.37% -18.03% -34.47% 01-Oct-01 1.79% 4.46% 0.76% 1.55% -2.70% 11.69% 0.59% 6.37% -0.17% -2.15% -3.77% -0.35% 11.26% 01-Nov-01 7.25% 17.90% 4.73% 11.18% 7.89% 5.43% 5.86% 11.15% 9.61% 5.58% 19.65% 20.01% 12.09% 03-Dec-01 0.75% -8.22% -3.67% 8.10% 9.97% 5.25% 9.68% -4.22% 2.29% 4.45% -2.25% 8.94% 2.03% 02-Jan-02 -1.57% 0.83% -6.84% 0.67% 5.43% -5.96% -3.09% 3.83% 1.65% -7.58% 5.08% -1.81% -0.63% 01-Feb-02 -2.10% 5.14% -0.18% 1.68% 11.97% -4.64% 9.88% 6.66% 8.80% 4.03% 4.55% -0.19% 13.14%01-Mar-02 3.61% 0.47% -2.52% 11.66% 4.85% 9.02% 2.38% 0.66% 0.36% -2.89% 13.20% -2.72% 0.41%RETURN DATA FOR THE DOW-JONES INDUSTRIAL STOCKS AND THE STANDARD AND POORS 500 July 2001 - July 2006 =AVERAGE(C9:C68) =SLOPE(C9:C68,$B$9:$B$68) =INTERCEPT(C9:C68,$B$9:$B$68) =RSQ(C9:C68,$B$9:$B$68) We first transform these price data to returns: The First-Pass Regression Row 4 gives each asset ’ s average monthly return over the 60-month period (to annualize these returns, we would multiply by 12). Rows 5–7 report the results of the first-pass regression . For each asset i we report the regression r it = α i + β i r SP , t . We use the Excel function Slope to compute the β of each asset, and the functions Intercept and Rsq to compute the α and R 2 for each regression. 278 Chapter 11 As a check, we also compute the α , β , and R 2 for the S&P 500 index (column B). Not surprisingly, α SP = 0, β SP = 1, R 2 = 1. The Second-Pass Regression The SML postulates that the mean return of each security should be linearly related to its beta. Assuming that the historic data provide an accurate descrip-tion of the distribution of future returns, we postulate that E ( R i ) = α + β i Π + ε i , where the definitions of α and Π depend on whether we are in Case 1 or Case 2 of section 11.1: α=()r Erf zCase there exists a risk-free asset Case no risk-free1 2: :a asset has zero correlation with efficient portfolio.z y Er⎧ ⎨⎪ ⎩⎪ = ΠMMf yzr Er Er()− ()−()⎧⎨⎩Case Case1 2 In the second step of our test of the CAPM, we examine this hypothesis by regressing the mean returns on the β ’ s. 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 2425 26 2728 29 3031 32H G F E D C B A StockAverage monthly return Beta Alpha 3 2 0 0 . 0 - 8 2 0 9 . 1 % 9 0 . 0 - A A a o c l A Second-pass regression, regressing monthly returns on Beta American International Group AIG -0.54% 0.9936 -0.0061 Intercept 0.0036 <-- =INTERCEPT(B3:B32,C3:C32) American Express AXP 0.72% 1.3784 0.0062 Slope -0.0020 <-- =SLOPE(B3:B32,C3:C32) ) 2 3 C : 3 C , 2 3 B : 3 B ( Q S R = - - < 8 3 2 0 . 0 d e r a u q s - R 8 5 0 0 . 0 5 1 5 1 . 1 % 7 6 . 0 A B g n i e o B 1 2 0 0 . 0 2 5 9 2 . 1 % 0 3 . 0 C p u o r g i t i C ) 2 3 C : 3 C , 2 3 B : 3 B ( t p e c r e t n i t = - - < 1 8 3 2 . 1 t p e c r e t n i , c i t s i t a t s - t 9 6 1 0 . 0 3 0 9 3 . 1 % 9 7 . 1 T A C r a l l i p r e t a C ) 2 3 C : 3 C , 2 3 B : 3 B ( e p o l s t = - - < 4 5 2 8 . 0 - e p o l s , c i t s i t a t s - t 1 1 0 0 . 0 9 0 0 0 . 1 % 8 1 . 0 D D t n o P u D 0 2 0 0 . 0 5 0 8 2 . 1 % 9 2 . 0 S I D y e n s i D General Electric GE -0.23% 0.8420 -0.0030 General Motors GM -0.87% 1.4060 -0.0097 3 6 0 0 . 0 - 8 2 5 5 . 1 % 2 5 . 0 - D H t o p e D e m o H 7 1 0 0 . 0 0 4 6 6 . 1 % 9 2 . 0 N O H l l e w y e n o H Hewlett Packard HPQ 0.61% 1.9594 0.0046 8 5 0 0 . 0 - 4 6 7 5 . 1 % 7 4 . 0 - M B I 9 8 0 0 . 0 - 8 4 6 2 . 2 % 3 7 . 0 - C T N I l e t n I Johnson & Johnson JNJ 0.34% 0.2471 0.0032 5 0 0 0 . 0 7 1 9 7 . 1 % 8 1 . 0 M P J n a g r o M P J 9 0 0 0 . 0 0 9 5 3 . 0 % 2 1 . 0 O K a l o C a c o C 5 2 0 0 . 0 6 4 6 2 . 1 % 5 3 . 0 D C M s d l a n o D c M 9 5 0 0 . 0 4 0 5 6 . 0 % 4 6 . 0 M M M M 3 5 2 1 0 . 0 3 3 6 6 . 0 % 0 3 . 1 O M a i r t l A 8 6 0 0 . 0 - 9 9 0 6 . 0 % 3 6 . 0 - K R M k c r e M 3 4 0 0 . 0 - 9 1 2 1 . 1 % 5 3 . 0 - T F S M t f o s o r c i M 8 7 0 0 . 0 - 2 7 5 5 . 0 % 4 7 . 0 - E F P r e z i f P 3 9 0 0 . 0 7 8 6 1 . 0 % 4 9 . 0 G P e l b m a G r o t c o r P 0 5 0 0 . 0 - 5 7 2 1 . 1 % 1 4 . 0 - T T & T A United Technologies UTX 1.03% 1.0659 0.0095 7 5 0 0 . 0 - 1 3 2 0 . 1 % 9 4 . 0 - Z V n o z i r e V 0 3 0 0 . 0 - 0 0 0 6 . 0 % 5 2 . 0 - T M W t r a m l a W 3 8 0 0 . 0 5 5 4 6 . 0 % 8 8 . 0 M O X l i b o M n o x x ETHE SECOND-PASS REGRESSION 279 Estimating Betas and the Security Market Line The results (cells F4:G6) are very disappointing.

In section 11.9 we discuss this rate, which changed wildly over the 60 months surveyed. At this point it is enough to point out that the average monthly risk-free interest rate was 0.18% (or 0.0018, exactly half of γ 0 ). • γ 1 should correspond to E ( r M ) − r f . The average monthly return of the S&P 500 over the period was − 0.10% and the average monthly risk-free inter- est rate was 0.18%, so that γ 1 should be approximated by − 0.28% (or 0.0028). • Both the t -statistics for the i (cell G8) and the slope (cell G9) indicate that they are not statistically different from zero. 5 Our test of the SML has failed. The CAPM may have prescriptive validity, but it does not describe our data. Why Are the Results So Bad? The experiment we did—checking the CAPM by plotting the security market line—does not appear to have worked out very well. There does not appear to be much evidence in favor of the SML: Neither the R 2 of the regression nor the t -statistics give much evidence that there is a relation between expected return and portfolio β . There are a number of reasons why these disappointing results may hold: • One reason is that perhaps the CAPM itself does not hold. This could be true for a variety of reasons: Ⴛ\u0003 Perhaps in the market short sales of assets are restricted. Our derivation of the CAPM (see Chapter 9 on efficient portfolios) assumes that there are no short-sale restrictions. Clearly this is an unrealistic assumption. The computation of efficient portfolios when short sales are restricted is 5. The functions TIntercept and TSlope were created by the author. They are attached to the spreadsheet for this chapter and are discussed in Chapter 3. 280 Chapter 11 considered in Chapter 12. In this case, however, there are no simple relations (such as those proved in Chapter 9) between the returns of assets and their betas. In particular, if short sales are restricted, there is no reason to expect the SML to hold. Ⴛ Perhaps individuals do not have homogeneous probability assessments, or perhaps they do not have the same expectations of asset returns, variances, and covariances. • Perhaps the CAPM holds only for portfolios and not for single assets. • Perhaps our set of assets isn ’ t large enough: After all, the CAPM talks about all risky assets , whereas we have chosen—for illustrative purposes—to do our test on a very small subset of these assets. The literature on CAPM testing records tests in which the set of risky assets has been expanded to include bonds, real estate, and even non-diversifiable assets such as human capital. • Perhaps the “market portfolio” isn ’ t efficient. This possibility is suggested by the mathematics of Chapter 9 on efficient portfolios, and it is this sugges-tion which we further explore in the next section. • Perhaps the CAPM holds only if the market returns are positive (in the period surveyed they were, on average, negative). 11.3 Did We Learn Something? The results of our exercise in section 11.1 are quite disappointing. Did we learn anything positive from this exercise? Absolutely. For example, the regres-sion model does a pretty good job of describing individual asset returns in relation to the S&P 500: 281 Estimating Betas and the Security Market Line On average the S&P 500 describes about 35% of the variability of the DJ30 stocks, which have an average beta of 1.12. If we exclude the seven stocks with the lowest R 2 , the S&P describes almost 43% of the variation in the stocks’ returns: 0.000.501.001.502.002.50Beta and R2for Each Stock as Regressed on SP500 Beta R-squared 1 2 345 67 89 101112 13 141516 1718AB C D E F G H I Average alpha 0.06% <-- =AVERAGE('Page 277 bottom'!C6:AF6) Average beta 1.12 <-- =AVERAGE('Page 277 bottom'!C5:AF5) Average r-squared 0.3510 <-- =AVERAGE('Page 277 bottom'!C7:AF7) Average R2 for best regressions Cutoff for R20.2<-- Below we count all R2 which are greater than this number 9.8258 <-- =SUMIF('Page 277 bottom'!C7:AF7,\">\"&TEXT(B7,\"0.00\")) 23 <-- =COUNTIF('Page 277 bottom'!C7:AF7,\">\"&TEXT(B7,\"0.00\")) Average R20.4272 <-- =B8/B9 T-statistics for intercept and slope Alcoa AAAmerican International Group AIGAmerican Express AXPBoeing BACitigroup CCaterpillar CATDuPont DDDisney DIS t-stat for intercept 0.3144 0.6324 -1.0525 -0.1584 -0.2013 -1.6120 -0.0192 -0.0371 t-stat for slope 9.4942 5.6112 11.7783 4.3815 9.2729 7.8607 6.6993 6.0199 Average absolute t-stat for intercept 0.3998 <-- {=AVERAGE(ABS(B14:AE14))} Average t-statfor slope 5.7866 <-- =AVERAGE(B15:AE15)OUR SML EXERCISE: WHAT DID WE LEARN? 282 Chapter 11 Cell B10 above computes the average R 2 for those regressions which had an R 2 > 0.2. This is 23 of the Dow-Jones 30. So—on average the first-pass regressions are very significant. The average R 2 of 35% that we got for our first-pass regressions of the basic SML is actually a respectable number in finance. Students—influenced by over-enthusiastic statistics instructors and an overly linear view of the world—often feel that the R 2 of any convincing regression should be at least 90%. Finance does not appear to be a highly linear profession: A good rule of thumb is that any financial regression that gives an R 2 greater than 80% is possibly misspecified and misleading. 6 Another way to look at the significance of our results is to compute the t -statistics for the intercept and slope of the first-pass regressions (rows 14–15 above). While the intercepts are not significantly different from zero (since their t -statistic is less than 2), the slopes are very significant. An Excel Note: Computing the Absolute Value of an Array of Numbers In the computations above we use a neat Excel trick related to array functions (see Chapter 34). By using Abs as an array function (that is, by entering the function using [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Enter]), we can compute the average of the absolute values of a vector of numbers. A simple example is shown below: 1 2 3 45 67AB C D E F 8 6 - 3 - 2 - 1 s r e b m u N Average number -0.4000 < -- =AVERAGE(B3:F3) Average absolute number 4.0000 <-- {=AVERAGE(ABS(B3:F3))} The above, but not as array function 1.0000 <-- =AVERAGE(ABS(B3:F3))USING ABS FUNCTION IN ARRAY The Excel \"Abs\" function computes the absolute value If we use it as an array function, it can be applied to a range of numbers 6. An exception to this useful rule relates to diversified portfolios—here the R 2 increases dramatically. Notice cell B7: Using the same function as a regular function does not produce the correct answer. 283 Estimating Betas and the Security Market Line 11.4 The Non-Efficiency of the “Market Portfolio” When we calculated the SML in section 11.1, we regressed the mean return of each asset on the returns of the market portfolio. The propositions of Chapter 9 on efficient portfolios suggest that our failure to find adequate results may stem from the fact that the S&P 500 portfolio is not efficient rela-tive to the set of the six assets which we have chosen. Proposition 3 of Chapter 9 states that if we had chosen to regress our asset returns on a portfolio that is efficient with respect to the asset set itself, we would get an r -squared of 100%. Proposition 4 of Chapter 9 shows that if we get an r -squared of 100% then the portfolio on which we regress the asset returns is necessarily efficient with respect to the set of assets. In this section we give a numerical illustration of these propositions. In the spreadsheet below we create a “mysterious portfolio” in column B. This portfolio (its construction is described in the next subsection) is efficient with respect to the Dow-Jones 30. As you can see in cells A10:B12, when we perform the second-pass regression—regressing the individual average returns of the assets on their betas computed with respect to the mysterious portfo-lio—the results are perfect. The resulting regression has an intercept of 0.0030 and a slope of 0.0425. Most important—it has an R 2 of 100%. 1 2 3 4 5 678 9 10 111213 14 1516 17 18 19AB C D E F G H I J K L M N DateMysterious portfolioAlcoa AAAmerican International Group AIGAmerican Express AXPBoeing BACitigroup CCaterpillar CATDuPont DDDisney DISGeneral Electric GEGeneral Motors GMHome Depot HDHoneywell HON Average return 4.55% -0.09% -0.54% 0.72% 0.67% 0.30% 1.79% 0.18% 0.29% -0.23% -0.87% -0.52% 0.29% 0 0 . 0 9 1 . 0 - 8 2 . 0 - 3 1 . 0 - 0 0 . 0 3 0 . 0 - 5 3 . 0 0 0 . 0 9 0 . 0 0 1 . 0 0 2 . 0 - 9 0 . 0 - a t e B % 0 3 . 0 % 6 3 . 0 % 8 3 . 0 % 4 3 . 0 % 0 3 . 0 % 1 3 . 0 % 9 1 . 0 % 0 3 . 0 % 7 2 . 0 % 7 2 . 0 % 6 3 . 0 % 3 3 . 0 a h p l A 0 0 0 0 . 0 3 4 1 0 . 0 6 7 1 0 . 0 6 2 1 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 9 7 5 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 4 2 0 0 . 0 4 6 0 0 . 0 2 4 2 0 . 0 5 2 0 0 . 0 d e r a u q s - R SML--regressing the average returns on the betas Intercept 0.0030 <-- =INTERCEPT(C4:AF4,C5:AF5) Slope 0.0425 <-- =SLOPE(C4:AF4,C5:AF5) R-squared 1.0000 <-- =RSQ(C4:AF4,C5:AF5) 01-Aug-01 -1.01% -2.49% -6.20% -10.20% -13.09% -8.88% -9.67% -3.59% -3.58% -6.16% -14.20% -9.11% 1.58% 04-Sep-01 0.40% -20.66% -0.25% -22.59% -42.42% -12.30% -11.01% -8.77% -31.14% -9.02% -24.37% -18.03% -34.47% 01-Oct-01 4.71% 4.46% 0.76% 1.55% -2.70% 11.69% 0.59% 6.37% -0.17% -2.15% -3.77% -0.35% 11.26% 01-Nov-01 -1.33% 17.90% 4.73% 11.18% 7.89% 5.43% 5.86% 11.15% 9.61% 5.58% 19.65% 20.01% 12.09% 03-Dec-01 8.11% -8.22% -3.67% 8.10% 9.97% 5.25% 9.68% -4.22% 2.29% 4.45% -2.25% 8.94% 2.03%RETURN DATA FOR THE DOW-JONES INDUSTRIAL STOCKS AND THE STANDARD AND POORS 500 July 2001 - July 2006 The Mysterious Portfolio Is Efficient The propositions of Chapter 9 leave us with only one conclusion: The “mys- terious portfolio” must be efficient with respect to the DJ30. And so it is. In 284 Chapter 11 the spreadsheet below we show the construction of this efficient portfolio, which follows the propositions of Chapter 9. • We first construct the variance-covariance matrix S using the function Var- covar defined in Chapter 10. • We then compute the efficient portfolio by solving SE r c SE r c− −()− [] ()− []∑1 1 . In the spreadsheet below we use c = 0.0030, which then turns out to be the intercept of the second-pass regression. 1 2 3 456 7 89 10 11 12 1314 15 67 68 69 70 71727374 75 76 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109110 111 112113 114 115 116117 118 119 120121 122 123 124 125126127 128 129 130 131 132 133134 135 136 137AB C D E F G H I J K L M N DateSP 500 Index ^SPXAlcoa AAAmerican International Group AIGAmerican Express AXPBoeing BACitigroup CCaterpillar CATDuPont DDDisney DISGeneral Electric GEGeneral Motors GMHome Depot HDHoneywell HON Average return 0.07% -0.09% -0.54% 0.72% 0.67% 0.30% 1.79% 0.18% 0.29% -0.23% -0.87% -0.52% 0.29% Beta 1.00 1.90 0.99 1.38 1.15 1.30 1.39 1.00 1.28 0.84 1.41 1.55 1.66 % 7 1 . 0 % 3 6 . 0 - % 7 9 . 0 - % 0 3 . 0 - % 0 2 . 0 % 1 1 . 0 % 9 6 . 1 % 1 2 . 0 % 8 5 . 0 % 2 6 . 0 % 1 6 . 0 - % 3 2 . 0 - 0 a h p l A R-squared 1 0.6085 0.3518 0.7052 0.2487 0.5972 0.5158 0.4362 0.3845 0.3221 0.2607 0.5288 0.5473 01-Aug-01 -6.63% -2.49% -6.20% -10.20% -13.09% -8.88% -9.67% -3.59% -3.58% -6.16% -14.20% -9.11% 1.58% 04-Sep-01 -8.53% -20.66% -0.25% -22.59% -42.42% -12.30% -11.01% -8.77% -31.14% -9.02% -24.37% -18.03% -34.47% 01-Oct-01 1.79% 4.46% 0.76% 1.55% -2.70% 11.69% 0.59% 6.37% -0.17% -2.15% -3.77% -0.35% 11.26% 01-Nov-01 7.25% 17.90% 4.73% 11.18% 7.89% 5.43% 5.86% 11.15% 9.61% 5.58% 19.65% 20.01% 12.09% 03-Dec-01 0.75% -8.22% -3.67% 8.10% 9.97% 5.25% 9.68% -4.22% 2.29% 4.45% -2.25% 8.94% 2.03% 02-Jan-02 -1.57% 0.83% -6.84% 0.67% 5.43% -5.96% -3.09% 3.83% 1.65% -7.58% 5.08% -1.81% -0.63% 01-Feb-02 -2.10% 5.14% -0.18% 1.68% 11.97% -4.64% 9.88% 6.66% 8.80% 4.03% 4.55% -0.19% 13.14% 01-Jun-06 0.01% 2.00% -2.92% -2.13% -1.62% -2.15% 2.08% -2.21% -1.65% -3.14% 10.09% -5.91% -2.16% 03-Jul-06 -0.37% 3.61% -0.14% -2.08% -2.37% 1.71% -2.58% -2.58% -0.57% 1.03% -1.05% -1.18% -3.38% The cells below compute the variance-covariance matrix fo r the DJ30 by using the formula {=varcovar(C9:AF68)} AA AIG AXP BA CC A TD DD I S G E G M H D H O N H P Q AA 0.0093 0.0032 0.0038 0.0045 0.0033 0.0046 0.0040 0.0042 0.0024 0.0046 0.0046 0.0061 0.0060 AIG 0.0032 0.0044 0.0020 0.0010 0.0023 0.0022 0.0022 0.0015 0.0015 0.0019 0.0021 0.0027 0.0024 AXP 0.0038 0.0020 0.0042 0.0030 0.0031 0.0029 0.0020 0.0037 0.0019 0.0033 0.0033 0.0042 0.0050 BA 0.0045 0.0010 0.0030 0.0083 0.0014 0.0029 0.0021 0.0037 0.0020 0.0043 0.0026 0.0053 0.0042 UTX 0.0038 0.0012 0.0031 0.0050 0.0022 0.0026 0.0021 0.0038 0.0018 0.0030 0.0023 0.0049 0.0048 VZ 0.0028 0.0018 0.0019 0.0007 0.0023 0.0022 0.0018 0.0014 0.0013 0.0006 0.0016 0.0024 0.0030 WMT 0.0018 0.0014 0.0011 0.0003 0.0015 0.0011 0.0014 0.0009 0.0009 0.0012 0.0024 0.0008 0.0008 XOM 0.0024 0.0010 0.0010 0.0017 0.0009 0.0021 0.0012 0.0004 0.0007 0.0020 0.0007 0.0020 0.0012 Finding an efficient portfolio Constant 0.30% AA 5.45% <-- {=MMULT(MINVERSE(varcov),TRANSPOSE(C4:AF4)-B105)/SUM(MMULT(MINVERSE(varcov),TRANSPOSE(C4:AF4)-B105))} AIG -11.77% AXP -5.78% BA -13.94% C -36.60% CAT 76.26% DD -22.55% DIS -17.05% GE -8.80% GM -37.73% HD -37.21% HON -17.40% HPQ 39.79% IBM -26.38% INTC -18.62% JNJ 65.08% JPM 53.61% KO -12.95% MCD -12.18% MMM -2.07% MP 42.15% MRK 8.29% MSFT 3.61% PFE -61.19% PG 54.67% T -8.38% UTX 44.05% VZ -36.55% WMT 64.78% XOM 29.40% Sum 100.00%RETURN DATA FOR THE DOW-JONES INDUSTRIAL STOCKS AND THE STANDARD AND POORS 500 July 2001 - July 2006 =AVERAGE(C9:C68) =SLOPE(C9:C68,$B$9:$B$68) =INTERCEPT(C9:C68,$B$9:$B$68) =RSQ(C9:C68,$B$9:$B$68) 285 Estimating Betas and the Security Market Line 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 1011 12AB C D E F G H I J K L M N DateMysterious portfolioAlcoa AAAmerican International Group AIGAmerican Express AXPBoeing BACitigroup CCaterpillar CATDuPont DDDisney DISGeneral Electric GEGeneral Motors GMHome Depot HDHoneywell HON Average return 8.88% -0.09% -0.54% 0.72% 0.67% 0.30% 1.79% 0.18% 0.29% -0.23% -0.87% -0.52% 0.29% 3 0 . 0 - 2 1 . 0 - 6 1 . 0 - 9 0 . 0 - 2 0 . 0 - 4 0 . 0 - 5 1 . 0 2 0 . 0 - 2 0 . 0 3 0 . 0 2 1 . 0 - 7 0 . 0 - a t e B % 1 5 . 0 % 6 5 . 0 % 8 5 . 0 % 4 5 . 0 % 1 5 . 0 % 2 5 . 0 % 2 4 . 0 % 1 5 . 0 % 9 4 . 0 % 9 4 . 0 % 6 5 . 0 % 4 5 . 0 a h p l A 9 0 0 0 . 0 7 3 2 0 . 0 9 5 2 0 . 0 6 5 2 0 . 0 0 1 0 0 . 0 5 4 0 0 . 0 7 6 4 0 . 0 5 1 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 9 1 0 0 . 0 9 9 3 0 . 0 1 6 0 0 . 0 d e r a u q s - R SML--regressing the average returns on the betasIntercept 0.0050 <-- =INTERCEPT(C4:AF4,C5:AF5) Slope 0.0838 <-- =SLOPE(C4:AF4,C5:AF5) R-squared 1.0000 <-- =RSQ(C4:AF4,C5:AF5)RETURN DATA FOR THE DOW-JONES INDUSTRIAL STOCKS AND THE STANDARD AND POORS 500 July 2001 - July 2006 The “mysterious portfolio” is not unique. Following we show results using another constant c, which gives another version of the SML. Note also that even though the R 2 of the second pass regression is 100% (since the “mysterious portfolio” is efficient), the R 2 ’ s of the individual first- pass regressions are far from notable. 11.5 So What ’ s the Real Market Portfolio? How Can We Test the CAPM? A little reflection will reveal that although the “mysterious” portfolio of the previous section may be efficient with respect to the 30 stocks of the Dow-Jones, it could not be the true market portfolio , even if the DJ30 stocks rep- resented the whole universe of risky securities. This is because many of the stocks appear in the “mysterious portfolio” with negative weights. Surely a minimal characteristic of the market portfolio must be that all shares appear in it with positive proportions . Roll (1977, 1978) suggests that the only test of the CAPM is to answer the question: Is the true market portfolio mean-variance efficient? If the answer to this question is “yes,” then it follows from Proposition 3 of Chapter 9 that a linear relation holds between the mean of each portfolio and its β . In our example, we can shed some light on this question by building a table of the asset proportions of portfolios on the efficient frontier. In the table below we give some evidence that all efficient portfolios for the DJ30 contain significant short positions. Using the wonders of Excel ’ s Data Table , we compute the largest short and long positions for a series of efficient portfolios, each defined by its own constant c . All of these portfolios contain large short positions (and, as you can see, also large long positions): 286 Chapter 11 105 106 107108109110111112113114115116117118119120121122123124125126127128129130131132133134135136137138139140141AB C D E F G H I An efficient portfolio Constant 0.30%Largest shortLargest long Constant c <-- Data table hidden: =B141 AA 5.5% 0.00% -32.64% 52.33% AIG -11.8% 0.05% -35.51% 53.58% AXP -5.8% 0.10% -38.87% 55.05% BA -13.9% 0.15% -42.86% 56.79% C -36.6% 0.20% -47.69% 59.70% CAT 76.3% 0.25% -53.65% 67.01% DD -22.6% 0.30% -61.19% 76.26% DIS -17.0% 0.35% -71.01% 88.32% GE -8.8% 0.40% -84.36% 104.71% GM -37.7% 0.45% -103.56% 128.28% HD -37.2% 0.50% -133.51% 165.05% HON -17.4% 0.55% -186.77% 230.42% HPQ 39.8% 0.60% -307.86% 379.08% IBM -26.4% 0.65% -853.66% 1049.09% INTC -18.6% 0.70% -1398.93% 1140.50% JNJ 65.1% 0.75% -422.59% 345.18% JPM 53.6% 0.80% -249.90% 204.50% KO -13.0% MCD -12.2% MMM -2.1% MP 42.1% MRK 8.3% MSFT 3.6% PFE -61.2% PG 54.7% T -8.4% UTX 44.1% VZ -36.6% WMT 64.8% XOM 29.4% Sum 100.0% Largest short -61.2% <-- =MIN(B108:B137) Largest long 76.3% <-- =MAX(B108:B137)Data table: computing the largest short and long position for a given constant c Our depressing conclusion: If the data for the DJ30 and the S&P 500 are representative, the CAPM as a descriptive theory of capital markets appears not to work. 7 11.6 Using Excess Returns Perhaps we should have conducted our experiment on the CAPM in terms of excess returns—the difference between the stocks’ monthly returns and the risk-free rates? In this section we perform this variation on the experiment and show that it does little to improve our analysis. 7. All is not lost! In Chapter 13 we examine the Black-Litterman model, which is a more positivist approach to portfolio choice. 287 Estimating Betas and the Security Market Line Below we show the same Dow-Jones data, with an additional column appended for Treasury bill returns; these varied wildly over the period: 1 2 34 5 6789 10 11 12131415 16 1718192021 22 2324252627 28 29303132 33 34AB C D E F G H I J K L M N O DateTreasury bill return risk-free rateS&P 500 Index ^GSPCAlcoa AAAmerican International Group AIGAmerican Express AXPBoeing BACitigroup CCaterpillar CATDuPont DDDisney DISGeneral Electric GEGeneral Motors GMHome Depot HDHoneywell HON Average return -0.22% -0.38% -0.83% 0.43% 0.37% 0.01% 1.50% -0.11% 0.00% -0.53% -1.16% -0.81% 0.00% 6 6 . 1 5 5 . 1 1 4 . 1 4 8 . 0 8 2 . 1 0 0 . 1 9 3 . 1 0 3 . 1 5 1 . 1 8 3 . 1 9 9 . 0 0 9 . 1 0 0 . 1 a t e B % 6 3 . 0 % 7 4 . 0 -

Is the game lost? Do we have to give up on the CAPM? Not totally: • First of all, it could be that the mean returns are approximately described by their regression on a market portfolio. In this alternative description of the CAPM, we claim (with some justification) that the β of an asset (which mea- sures the dependence of the asset ’ s returns on the market returns) is an impor- tant measure of the asset ’ s risk. • Second, the CAPM might be a good normative description of how to choose portfolios. As we showed in the appendix of Chapter 3, larger diversi-fied portfolios are quite well described by their betas, so that the average beta of a well-diversified portfolio may be a reasonable description of the portfolio ’ s risk.

Explain your results in light of Propositions 3 and 4 from Chapter 9. 1 2 Efficient Portfolios Without Short Sales 12.1 Overview In Chapter 9 we discussed the problem of finding an efficient portfolio. As shown there, this problem can be written as finding a tangent portfolio on the envelope of the feasible set of portfolios: Finding Envelope Portfolios sigmamean x c The proof in the Appendix to Chapter 9 for solving for such an efficient portfolio involved finding the solution to the following problem: max() () ( )Θ=− = =⋅ == =∑Er c x Er x R x Erx p i iN xT ii iNσ such that where1 1 1∑ ∑ ∑ ∑ == = =σ σ pT iji j jN iN xS x x x 1 1 Proposition 1 of Chapter 9 gives a methodology for solving this problem. Solutions to the maximization problem allow negative portfolio proportions; 292 Chapter 12 when x i < 0, this assumes that the i th security is sold short by the investor and that the proceeds from this short sale become immediately available to the investor. Reality is, of course, considerably more complicated than this academic model of short sales. In particular, it is rare for all of the short-sale proceeds to become available to the investor at the time of investment, since brokerage houses typically escrow some or even all of the proceeds. It may also be that the investor is completely prohibited from making any short sales (indeed, most small investors seem to proceed on the assumption that short sales are impossible). 1 In this chapter we investigate these problems. We show how to use Excel ’ s Solver to find efficient portfolios of assets when we restrict short sales. 2 12.2 A Numerical Example We start with the problem of finding an optimal portfolio when no short sales are allowed. The problem we solve is similar to the maximization problem stated above, with the addition of the short-sales constraint x i > 0 for the asset proportions: max() ,, ,Θ=− = ≥= …=∑Er c x xi Nx p i iN iσ such that where1 011 1. The actual procedures for implementing a short sale are not simple. A well-written academic survey is a recent paper by Gene D’Avolio, “The Market for Borrowing Stock,” Journal of Finan- cial Economics (2003). There ’ s also a wonderful article, “Get Shorty,” in the 1 December 2003 issue of The New Yorker magazine by James Surowiecki. 2. We do not go into the efficient set mathematics when short sales of assets are restricted. This involves the Kuhn-Tucker conditions, a discussion of which can be found in Edwin Elton, Martin Gruber, Stephen Brown, and W. N. Goetzmann, Modern Portfolio Theory and Investment Analysis (Wiley, 8th edition, 2009). 293 Efficient Portfolios Without Short Sales Er x R x Er xS x x xxT ii iN pT iji j jN iN() ( ) =⋅ = === = =∑ ∑ ∑1 1 1σ σ Solving an Unconstrained Portfolio Problem To set the scene, we consider the optimization problem below, which we solve without any short-sale constraints. The spreadsheet shows a four-asset variance-covariance matrix and associated expected returns. Given a constant c = 8%, the optimal portfolio is given in cells B11:B14. Notice θ in cell B19: This is the Sharpe ratio of the portfolio, the ratio of its excess return over the constant c to its standard deviation: θσ=()− Er c x x .

Starting from an arbitrary portfolio (the spreadsheet below uses x 1 = x 2 = x 3 = x 4 = 0.25), we use Solver to find a solution: 294 Chapter 12 The Solver solution maximizes θ (cell B19) subject to the constraint that cell B15, which contains the sum of the portfolio positions, equals 1. 3 When we press Solve we get the solution we achieved before: 3. If Tools|Solver doesn ’ t work, you may not have loaded the Solver add-in. To do so, go to Tools|Add-ins and click next to the Solver Add-in . 295 Efficient Portfolios Without Short Sales Solving a Constrained Portfolio Problem The optimal solution above contains a short position in asset 4. To restrict the short selling, we add a no-short-sale constraint to Solver . Starting from an arbitrary solution, we bring up Solver as shown below: Pressing Solve yields the following solution: 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 18 19H G F E D C B A Vs n a e M x i r t a m e c n a i r a v o c - e c n a i r a 0.10 0.03 -0.08 0.05 8% 0.03 0.20 0.02 0.03 9% -0.08 0.02 0.30 0.20 10% 0.05 0.03 0.20 0.90 11% c 3.0% <-- This is the constant Here we start with an arbitrary feasible portfolio and use Solve r x1 0.5856 x2 0.0965 x3 0.3179 x4 0.0000 ) 4 1 B : 1 1 B ( M U S = - - < 1 l a t o T Portfolio mean 8.73% <-- {=MMULT(TRANSPOSE(B11:B14),G3:G6)} Portfolio sigma 20.32% <-- {=SQRT(MMULT(TRANSPOSE(B11:B14),MMULT(B3:E6,B11:B14)))} = Theta = (mean-constant)/sigma 28.21% <-- =(B17-C8)/B18PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION WITHOUT SHORT SALES Solution with Solver, starting from an arbitrary feasible portfolio θ 296 Chapter 12 The non-negativity constraints is added by clicking on the Add button in the Solver dialogue box. This brings up the following window (shown here filled in): The second constraint (which constrains the portfolio proportions to sum to 1) is added in a similar fashion. An Alternative Method There ’ s another way of doing this.

Recall that in the case of no short-sale restrictions discussed in Chapter 9, it was enough to find two efficient portfolios in order to determine the whole efficient frontier (this was proved in Proposition 2 of Chapter 9). When we impose short-sale restrictions, this statement is no longer true. In this case the determination of the efficient frontier requires the plotting of a large number of points. The only efficient (pardon the pun!) way of doing this is with a VBA program which repeatedly applies the Solver and puts the solutions in a table. In section 12.3 we describe such a program. Once we have the program and the graph of the efficient frontier without short sales, we can compare this efficient frontier to the efficient frontier with short sales allowed: 299 Efficient Portfolios Without Short Sales The relation between these two graphs is not all that surprising: • In general, the efficient frontier with short sales dominates the efficient frontier without short sales. This must clearly be so, since the short-sales restriction imposes an extra constraint on the maximization problem. • For some cases, the two efficient frontiers coincide. One such point occurs, as we saw above, when c = 8%. Putting these two graphs on one set of axes shows that the effect of the short-sale restrictions is mainly for portfolios with higher returns and sigmas. 12.4 A VBA Program for the Efficient Frontier Without Short Sales The output for the restricted short-sale case shown in section 12.3 was pro-duced with the following VBA program: 6%7%8%9%10%11%12%13% 18% 28% 38% 48% 58% 68% 78% 88% 98%Mean Return (%) Sigma (%)Comparing Two Efficient Frontiers For low sigmas the two frontiers coincide For higher sigmas, no restrictions on short sales gives higher returns No short sales Short sales allowed 300 Chapter 12 Sub Solve() SolverOk SetCell: = ”$B$19”, MaxMinVal: = 1, ValueOf: = ”0”, ByChange: = ”$B$11:$B$14” SolverSolve UserFinish: = True End Sub Sub Doit() Range(“Results”).ClearContents For counter = 1 To 40 Range(“constant”) = -0.04 + counter * 0.005 Solve Application.SendKeys (“{Enter}”) Range(“Results”).Cells(counter, 1) _ ActiveSheet.Range(“constant”) Range(“Results”).Cells(counter, 2) _ ActiveSheet.Range(“portfolio_sigma”) Range(“Results”).Cells(counter, 3) _ ActiveSheet.Range(“portfolio_mean”) Range(“Results”).Cells(counter, 4) _ ActiveSheet.Range(“x_1”) Range(“Results”).Cells(counter, 5) _ ActiveSheet.Range(“x_2”) Range(“Results”).Cells(counter, 6) _ ActiveSheet.Range(“x_3”) Range(“Results”).Cells(counter, 7) _ ActiveSheet.Range(“x_4”) Next counter End Sub ActiveSheet.Range(“x_3”) Range(“Results”).Cells(counter, 7) = _ ActiveSheet.Range(“x_4”) Next counter End Sub The program includes two subroutines: Solve calls the Excel Solver; and the subroutine Doit repeatedly calls the solver for different values of the range named Constant (this is cell C8 in the spreadsheet), putting the output in a range called “Results.” 301 Efficient Portfolios Without Short Sales The final output looks like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25AB C D E F G H I J K L M N O RESULTS x n a e M a m g i S c s n a e M x i r t a m e c n a i r a v o c - e c n a i r a V 1 x2 x3 0.10 0.03 -0.08 0.05 8% Ctrl+A works the VBA program -0.035 20.24% 8.70% 0.6049 0.0885 0.3066 0.03 0.20 0.02 0.03 9% which calculates effic ient -0.03 20.25% 8.70% 0.6042 0.0887 0.3070 -0.08 0.02 0.30 0.20 10% portfolios for no-short sales. -0.025 20.25% 8.70% 0.6035 0.0890 0.3075 0.05 0.03 0.20 0.90 11% This program iteratively -0.02 20.25% 8.71% 0.6027 0.0893 0.3080 substitutes a constant ranging -0.015 20.25% 8.71% 0.6017 0.0897 0.3086 2 9 0 3 . 0 1 0 9 0 . 0 7 0 0 6 . 0 % 1 7 . 8 % 6 2 . 0 2 1 0 . 0 - % 2 / 1 ( % 6 1 l l i t ' % 5 . 3 - m o r f t n a t s n o c e h t s i s i h T - - < % 0 . 6 1 c jumps) and calculates the -0.005 20.26% 8.71% 0.5994 0.0908 0.3098 6 0 1 3 . 0 2 1 9 0 . 0 2 8 9 5 . 0 % 1 7 . 8 % 7 2 . 0 2 0 . o i l o f t r o p l a m i t p o x1 0.0000 0 0.005 20.27% 8.71% 0.5968 0.0917 0.3115 x2 0.0000 0 0.01 20.28% 8.72% 0.5950 0.0926 0.3123 x3 0.0000 0 0.015 20.29% 8.72% 0.5932 0.0934 0.3134 x4 1.0000 0 0.02 20.30% 8.72% 0.5910 0.0943 0.3147 Total 1.0000 <-- =SUM(B11:B14) 0.025 20.31% 8.73% 0.5885 0.0953 0.3161 0.03 20.32% 8.73% 0.5856 0.0965 0.3179 9 9 1 3 . 0 0 8 9 0 . 0 1 2 8 5 . 0 % 4 7 . 8 % 4 3 . 0 2 5 3 0 . 0 } ) 6 G : 3 G , ) 4 1 B : 1 1 B ( E S O P S N A R T ( T L U M M = { - - < % 0 0 . 1 1 n a e m o i l o f t r o P 4 2 2 3 . 0 8 9 9 0 . 0 9 7 7 5 . 0 % 4 7 . 8 % 7 3 . 0 2 4 0 . 0 } ) ) ) 4 1 B : 1 1 B , 6 E : 3 B ( T L U M M , ) 4 1 B : 1 1 B ( E S O P S N A R T ( T L U M M ( T R Q S = { - - < % 7 8 . 4 9 a m g i s o i l o f t r o P Theta -5.27% <-- =(B17-C8)/B18 0.045 20.41% 8.75% 0.5726 0.1019 0.3255 0.05 20.46% 8.76% 0.5659 0.1047 0.3294 0.055 20.54% 8.78% 0.5572 0.1083 0.3345 0.06 20.67% 8.80% 0.5452 0.1133 0.3415 0.065 20.90% 8.82% 0.5277 0.1205 0.3518 0.07 21.36% 8.87% 0.4992 0.1324 0.3684 0.075 23.27% 9.01% 0.4267 0.1630 0.3856PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION WITHOUT SHORT SALES Adding a Reference to Solver in VBA If the above routine does not work, you may need to add a reference to Solver in the VBA editor.

An enormous academic and practitioner literature (as well as several Nobel Prizes in Eco-nomics) testifies to the impact of this new point of view on asset valuation and portfolio choice. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that today no conversation about a stock ’ s risk is complete without mentioning its beta, and discussions of portfolio performance regularly invoke the alpha (both of these topics are discussed in Chapter 11). Markowitz, Sharpe, Lintner, and Mossin changed the paradigm of invest- ment management. Well before Markowitz et al., individual investors knew that they should “diversify” and not “put all their eggs in one basket.” But Markowitz and those who followed him gave statistical and implementational meaning to these clichés. Modern portfolio theory (MPT) changed the way intelligent investors discuss investment. Nevertheless, MPT has disappointed. It is possible to come away from a standard textbook discussion of portfolio optimization with the impression that a fixed set of mechanical optimization rules, combined with a bit of knowledge about personal preferences, suffices to define an investor ’ s optimal portfolio. Anyone who has tried to implement portfolio optimization using market data knows that the dream is often a nightmare. Implementations of portfolio theory produce wildly unrealistic portfolios, with huge short positions and corre-spondingly imaginary long positions. It might be thought that limiting short sales, as we have illustrated in Chapter 12, could solve some of these problems. However, short-sale limitations severely restrict the investible asset universe. The main problem with the mechanical implementation of portfolio optimi- zation is that historical asset return data produce bad predictions for future asset returns. The estimation of the covariances between asset returns and the estimation of expected returns—the underpinnings of portfolio theory—from historical data often produces unbelievable numbers. In Chapter 10 we alluded to some of these problems in the context of estimat- ing the variance-covariance matrix. There we showed that historical data may not be the best way to estimate this matrix—other methods, in particular the 306 Chapter 13 so-called “shrinkage” methods—may produce more reliable estimates of the covariances. In this chapter we take things a step further. We illustrate the prob-lems of standard portfolio optimization by using a 10-asset portfolio problem. The MPT optimization for our data produces an insane “optimal” portfolio, with many huge long and short positions. The problems of portfolio optimiza-tion illustrated in our example are, unfortunately, not unusual. Using the data in a mechanical way to derive “optimal” portfolios simply doesn ’ t work. 1 In 1991 Fischer Black and Robert Litterman of Goldman Sachs published an approach which deals with many of the problematics of portfolio optimiza-tion. 2 Black and Litterman start with the assumption that an investor chooses his optimal portfolio from among a given group of assets. This group of assets—it might be the Standard & Poor ’ s 500 Index, the Russell 2000, or a mix of international indices—defines the framework within which the investor chooses his portfolio. The investor ’ s universe of assets defines a benchmark portfolio. The Black-Litterman model takes as its starting point the assumption that, in the absence of additional information, the benchmark cannot be outper-formed. This assumption is based on much research, which shows that it is very difficult to outperform a typical well-diversified benchmark. 3 In effect the Black-Litterman model turns modern portfolio theory on its head—instead of inputting data and deriving an optimal portfolio, the BL 1. A paper by DeMiguel, Garlappi, and Uppal, “Optimal Versus Naive Diversification: How Inefficient Is the 1/N Portfolio Strategy?” in The Review of Financial Studies (2009), illustrates how badly mechanical optimization works. The authors examine optimal allocations among 10 sector portfolios. They find that a naive portfolio allocation rule of investing equal proportions in each portfolio—irrespective of market values—outperforms more sophisticated data-based optimizations. 2. Fischer Black and Robert Litterman, “Global Asset Allocation with Equities, Bonds, and Cur- rencies,” Goldman, Sachs & Co., Fixed Income Research (1991). Black and Litterman were apparently unaware of an earlier paper, which includes much of their research, by Sharpe, “Imput-ing Expected Security Returns from Portfolio Composition,” Journal of Financial and Quantita- tive Research (1974). Sharpe ’ s paper discusses the “reverse engineering” of the portfolio returns from portfolio composition. 3. “According to Lipper Analytical Services, over the 10 years ended in June 2000, more than 80% of ‘general equity’ mutual funds, meaning garden variety stock funds, underperformed the Standard and Poor ’ s 500 Index—the major benchmark for stock mutual funds” (quoted in www.fool.com/Seminars/OLA/2001/Retire1_4C.htm). Or, from a well-known academic: “Professional investment managers, both in the U.S. and abroad, do not outperform their index benchmarks” Burton G. Malkiel, “Reflections on the Efficient Market Hypothesis: 30 Years Later,” The Finan- cial Review (2005). 307 The Black-Litterman Approach to Portfolio Optimization approach assumes that a given portfolio is optimal and from this assumption derives the expected returns of the benchmark components. The implied vector of expected benchmark returns is the starting point of the BL model. The BL implied asset returns can be interpreted as the market ’ s information about the future returns of each asset in the benchmark portfolio. If our investor agrees with this market assessment, he ’ s finished: He can then buy the bench-mark, knowing that it is optimal. But what if he disagrees with one or more of the implied returns? BL shows how the investor ’ s opinions can be incorpo-rated into the optimization problem to produce a portfolio which is better for the investor. In this chapter we start with an illustration of the problematics of MPT. We then go on to illustrate the Black-Litterman approach. 13.2 A Naive Problem We start with a naive, though representative problem: The Super Duper Fund has set its benchmark portfolio to be a portfolio composed of 10 leading stocks.

To implement the port-folio optimization, she needs data on the T-bill rate: The 1 July 2006 T-bill rate is 4.83% annually and 4.83%/12 = 0.40% monthly. Using the variance- covariance matrix, the T-bill rate, and the historical mean returns, she com-putes an “optimal” portfolio by solving the equation: Optimal portf olio x x xSrr rr rrGM f HD f MMM f 12 1 01 ,, ,… {} =− − −⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢− /vertellipsis ⎢ ⎢⎤ ⎦⎥⎥⎥⎥ … []− − −⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥ =− −11 11 1,, , * * Srr rr rr SGM f HD f MMM f/vertellipsis rrr rr rr Sum Srr rr rGM f HD f MMM f GM f HD f MMM− − −⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥ − − − −/vertellipsis /vertellipsis1* r rf⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥ 310 Chapter 13 This portfolio is shown below (highlighted): 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32AB C D E F G H I J K L M General Motors GMHome Depot HDInternatio nal paper IPHewlett- Packard HPQAltria MOAmerican Express AXPAlcoa Aluminum AADuPont DDMerck MRKMMM Market cap (billion $) 16.85 73.98 15.92 88.37 153.33 65.66 28.16 38.32 79.51 60.9Benchmark proportion 2.71% 11.91% 2.56% 14.23% 24.69% 10.57% 4.53% 6.17% 12.80% 9.81% Variance-covariance matrix of excess returns GM HD IP HPQ MO AXP AA DD MRK MMMMean return % 7 8 . 0 - 4 1 0 0 . 0 0 1 0 0 . 0 8 1 0 0 . 0 6 4 0 0 . 0 3 3 0 0 . 0 4 1 0 0 . 0 2 4 0 0 . 0 4 2 0 0 . 0 1 3 0 0 . 0 8 1 1 0 . 0 M G % 9 3 . 0 - 8 1 0 0 . 0 2 0 0 0 . 0 0 2 0 0 . 0 6 4 0 0 . 0 3 3 0 0 . 0 2 2 0 0 . 0 3 4 0 0 . 0 9 1 0 0 . 0 2 7 0 0 . 0 1 3 0 0 . 0 D H % 6 0 . 0 6 1 0 0 . 0 2 1 0 0 . 0 1 2 0 0 . 0 3 4 0 0 . 0 4 2 0 0 . 0 1 0 0 0 . 0 1 3 0 0 . 0 0 4 0 0 . 0 9 1 0 0 . 0 4 2 0 0 . 0 P I % 0 3 . 0 2 2 0 0 . 0 0 2 0 0 . 0 3 3 0 0 . 0 1 6 0 0 . 0 9 4 0 0 . 0 6 2 0 0 . 0 9 1 1 0 . 0 1 3 0 0 . 0 3 4 0 0 . 0 2 4 0 0 . 0 Q P H % 7 0 . 1 8 0 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 9 0 0 0 . 0 8 1 0 0 . 0 6 1 0 0 . 0 7 7 0 0 . 0 6 2 0 0 . 0 1 0 0 0 . 0 2 2 0 0 . 0 4 1 0 0 . 0 O M % 2 8 . 0 4 1 0 0 . 0 1 1 0 0 . 0 9 1 0 0 . 0 8 3 0 0 . 0 2 4 0 0 . 0 6 1 0 0 . 0 9 4 0 0 . 0 4 2 0 0 . 0 3 3 0 0 . 0 3 3 0 0 . 0 P X A % 8 1 . 0 - 4 2 0 0 . 0 8 1 0 0 . 0 1 4 0 0 . 0 3 9 0 0 . 0 8 3 0 0 . 0 8 1 0 0 . 0 1 6 0 0 . 0 3 4 0 0 . 0 6 4 0 0 . 0 6 4 0 0 . 0 A A % 3 0 . 0 9 1 0 0 . 0 7 1 0 0 . 0 8 3 0 0 . 0 1 4 0 0 . 0 9 1 0 0 . 0 9 0 0 0 . 0 3 3 0 0 . 0 1 2 0 0 . 0 0 2 0 0 . 0 8 1 0 0 . 0 D D % 5 5 . 0 - 5 0 0 0 . 0 6 6 0 0 . 0 7 1 0 0 . 0 8 1 0 0 . 0 1 1 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 0 2 0 0 . 0 2 1 0 0 . 0 2 0 0 0 . 0 0 1 0 0 . 0 K R M % 5 7 . 0 1 3 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 9 1 0 0 . 0 4 2 0 0 . 0 4 1 0 0 . 0 8 0 0 0 . 0 2 2 0 0 . 0 6 1 0 0 . 0 8 1 0 0 . 0 4 1 0 0 . 0 M M M Current t-bill rate 0.40% <-- =4.83%/12 \"Optimal\" portfolio } ) ) 9 1 B - 7 1 M : 8 M , ) 7 1 K : 8 B ( E S R E V N I M ( T L U M M ( M U S / ) 9 1 B - 7 1 M : 8 M , ) 7 1 K : 8 B ( E S R E V N I M ( T L U M M = { - - < % 2 . 0 8 4 M G % 8 . 1 8 9 D H % 3 . 9 8 6 P I % 3 . 1 2 2 Q P H % 7 . 3 6 2 - O M AXP -1763.7% % 5 . 4 2 3 - A A % 8 . 8 2 5 D D % 5 . 9 6 4 K R M MMM -918.9% Sum of proportions 1.00000 <-- =SUM(B22:B31)SUPER DUPER BENCHMARK PORTFOLIO—NAIVE OPTIMIZATION The “optimal” portfolio shown in cells B22:B31 is clearly not practically implementable: It contains too many large positions (both negative and posi-tive). Note, for example, the –1763.7% short position in AXP and the 528.8% position in DD. Most mutual funds are prevented from taking short positions, and even funds which short sell will find it difficult to short sell 17.63 times the fund value in AXP or to invest 9.19 times the fund value in MMM. The enormous long positions which result from these short-sale positions (e.g., 9.82 times fund value invested long in HD) are similarly impracticable. Why Does Naive Optimization Fail? In some sense the strange portfolio “optimization” positions were predictable. The spreadsheet below highlights some disturbing features of the data which can partially explain the odd “optimized” portfolio. 311 The Black-Litterman Approach to Portfolio Optimization • A number of the historical mean returns are negative. If we ignore the effects of correlations, a negative expected return should imply a short position in the stock. 4 There is, however, a deeper philosophical question about using past returns as proxies for future expected returns: Even though the past returns are negative, there is no reason to assume that this means that the future, expected returns from a stock should be negative. This is one of the problems when we use historical data to extract anticipations about the future. • The correlations between asset returns are in some cases very large. Large correlations for a particular stock can lead us to prefer other stocks with smaller returns but more moderate correlations. The spreadsheet below highlights stocks with negative historical returns and stocks whose correlations are greater than 0.5. 1 2 3 4 56789 10 11 1213 14 15161718 19 20L K J I H G F E D C B A General Motors GMHome Depot HDInternational Paper IPHewlett- Packard HPQAltria MOAmerican Express AXPAlcoa Aluminum AADuPont DDMerck MRKMMM Market cap (billion $) 16.85 73.98 15.92 88.37 153.33 65.66 28.16 38.32 79.51 60.9 Benchmark proportion 2.71% 11.91% 2. 56% 14.23% 24.69% 10.57% 4.53% 6.17% 12.80% 9.81% Mean return -0.87% -0.39% 0.06% 0.30% 1 .07% 0.82% -0.18% 0.03% -0.55% 0.75% Return sigma 10.78% 8.41% 6.23% 10.80% 8.71% 6.43% 9.54% 6.12% 8.06% 5.54% GM HD IP HPQ MO AXP AA DD MRK MMM GM 1.0000 0.3320 0.3459 0.3534 0.1428 0.4676 0.4430 0.2737 0.1109 0.2277 <-- =CORREL($B$24:$B$83,K24:K83) 6 2 0 . 0 1 9 8 3 . 0 8 1 6 5 . 0 1 6 0 6 . 0 2 1 0 3 . 0 8 1 6 4 . 0 2 1 5 3 . 0 0 0 0 0 . 1 D H 0 0.3800 <-- =CORREL($C$24:$C$83,K24:K83) 0 2 6 3 2 . 0 0 0 4 5 . 0 1 8 1 7 . 0 2 7 7 5 . 0 9 5 1 0 . 0 0 8 5 4 . 0 0 0 0 0 . 1 P I .4575 <-- =CORREL($D$24:$D$83,K24:K83) 6 6 6 3 . 0 2 3 2 2 . 0 4 2 9 4 . 0 0 7 7 5 . 0 5 6 9 6 . 0 2 8 6 2 . 0 0 0 0 0 . 1 Q P H 5 4 6 1 . 0 5 5 9 0 . 0 7 4 6 1 . 0 5 4 1 2 . 0 9 3 8 2 . 0 0 0 0 0 . 1 O M AXP 1.0000 0.6034 0.4855 0.2038 0.3798 AA 1.0000 0.6863 0.2294 0.4525 DD 1.0000 0.3287 0.5606 MRK 1.0000 0.1079 MMM 1.0000NEGATIVE RETURNS AND HIGH CORRELATIONS What About Changing the Variance-Covariance Matrix? In Chapter 10 we discussed various methods for shrinking the variance- covariance matrix. “Shrinkage,” you will recall, is a bit of jargon for taking a convex combination of the sample variance-covariance matrix with a diagonal matrix of only the variances. Shrinkage methods have been shown to be effec-tive at improving the performance of the global minimum variance portfolio (GMVP). 4. In principle you might want to include a negative-return stock in your portfolio if it has a negative correlation with enough other stocks to lower the total portfolio variance. However, this rarely happens. 312 Chapter 13 Will shrinkage help us solve the extreme positions of the naive portfolio optimization? We try this in the next spreadsheet, where cells B11:K20 contain a weighted combination of the sample covariance matrix (B41:K50) and an all-diagonal matrix of only the variances (B54:K63). The weight λ put on the sample covariance matrix is given in cell B7. For λ = 0.3, the “optimal” portfolio indeed contains fewer extreme long and short positions. But it is clear that shrinkage can never solve the fundamental problem of the data—using negative historical returns as proxies for expected returns will always produce some negative portfolio positions in an optimizer. It is this problem which Black and Litterman solve and which we discuss in the next section. 1 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 1112 13 1415 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 2526 27 2829 30 3132 33 34 35AB C D E F G H I J K L M General Motors GMHome Depot HDInternational paper IPHewlett- Packard HPQAltria MOAmerican Express AXPAlcoa Aluminum AADuPont DDMerck MRKMMM Market cap (billion $) 16.85 73.98 15.92 88.37 153.33 65.66 28.16 38.32 79.51 60.9 Benchmark proportion 2.71% 11.91% 2.56% 14.23% 24.69% 10.57% 4.53% 6.17% 12.80% 9.81% Variance-covariance matrix of excess returns Shrinkage factor, 0.3 <-- Weight on sample var-cov matrix GM HD IP HPQ MO AXP AA DD MRK MMMMean return % 7 8 . 0 - 4 0 0 0 . 0 3 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 4 1 0 0 . 0 0 1 0 0 . 0 4 0 0 0 . 0 3 1 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 9 0 0 0 . 0 8 1 1 0 . 0 M G % 9 3 . 0 - 5 0 0 0 . 0 1 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 4 1 0 0 . 0 0 1 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 3 1 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 2 7 0 0 . 0 9 0 0 0 . 0 D H % 6 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 4 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 3 1 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 9 0 0 0 . 0 0 4 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 P I % 0 3 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 0 1 0 0 . 0 8 1 0 0 . 0 5 1 0 0 . 0 8 0 0 0 . 0 9 1 1 0 . 0 9 0 0 0 . 0 3 1 0 0 . 0 3 1 0 0 . 0 Q P H % 7 0 . 1 2 0 0 0 . 0 2 0 0 0 . 0 3 0 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 7 7 0 0 . 0 8 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 4 0 0 0 . 0 O M % 2 8 . 0 4 0 0 0 . 0 3 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 1 1 0 0 . 0 2 4 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 5 1 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 0 1 0 0 . 0 0 1 0 0 . 0 P X A % 8 1 . 0 - 7 0 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 2 1 0 0 . 0 3 9 0 0 . 0 1 1 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 8 1 0 0 . 0 3 1 0 0 . 0 4 1 0 0 . 0 4 1 0 0 . 0 A A % 3 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 8 3 0 0 . 0 2 1 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 3 0 0 0 . 0 0 1 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 D D % 5 5 . 0 - 1 0 0 0 . 0 6 6 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 3 0 0 0 . 0 2 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 4 0 0 0 . 0 1 0 0 0 . 0 3 0 0 0 . 0 K R M % 5 7 . 0 1 3 0 0 . 0 1 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 4 0 0 0 . 0 2 0 0 0 . 0 7 0 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 . 0 4 0 0 0 . 0 M M M Current T-bill rate 0.40% <-- =4.83%/12 \"Optimal\" portfolio B - 0 2 M : 1 1 M , ) 0 2 K : 1 1 B ( E S R E V N I M ( T L U M M = { - - < % 3 . 4 8 M G 22)/SUM(MMULT(MINVERSE(B11:K20),M11:M20-B22))} % 4 . 6 9 D H % 2 . 0 5 P I % 6 . 3 - Q P H % 1 . 6 7 - O M AXP -134.6% % 5 . 2 3 A A % 5 . 2 6 D D % 1 . 2 1 1 K R M MMM -123.8% Sum of proportions 1.0000 <-- =SUM(B25:B34)SUPER DUPER BENCHMARK PORTFOLIO—NAIVE OPTIMIZATION WITH SHRUNK VARIANCE-COVARIANCE MATRIX The matrix below is a weighted combination of the sample variance-covariance matrix and a pure diagonal matrix of only variance s. {=B7*B39:K48+(1-B7)*B52:K61}λ 313 The Black-Litterman Approach to Portfolio Optimization 13.3 Black and Litterman ’ s Solution to the Optimization Problem The Black-Litterman (BL) approach provides an initial solution to the optimi- zation problem above. The BL approach is composed of two parts: Step 1 : What does the market think? A vast amount of financial research shows that it is difficult to beat the returns of benchmark portfolios. The first step of the BL approach takes this research as a starting point. It assumes that the benchmark is optimal and derives the expected returns of each asset under this assumption. Another way of saying this is that in Step 1 we compute the expected returns of the assets which would make the investor choose the benchmark using the optimization techniques in Chapters 9–11. Step 2 : Incorporating investor opinions. In Step 1, BL shows how to compute the benchmark asset returns based on the assumption of optimality. Suppose the investor has divergent opinions from these market-based expected returns. Step 2 shows how to incorporate these opinions into the optimization proce-dure. Note that—because of the correlations between asset returns—an inves-tor ’ s opinion about any particular asset ’ s returns will affect all the other expected returns. A critical part in Step 2 is to adjust all asset returns for an investor ’ s opinion about any return. An investor who follows the Black-Litterman procedure starts off by seeing what the market weights imply for the expected returns. He can then adjust these weights by adding his own opinions about any asset’s expected returns. In the next two sections we discuss these two steps in detail. 13.4 BL Step 1: What Does the Market Think?

We have to be careful, however: Because asset returns are correlated, any opinion Joanna has about one asset ’ s returns will translate to an opinion about all other asset returns.

What this example illustrates is that—because asset returns are correlated through the variance-covariance matrix—an opinion about one asset ’ s returns 318 Chapter 13 (in this GM) also affects Joanna ’ s anticipated returns for all other assets.

Two or More Opinions Suppose Joanna believes the GM monthly return will be 1.10% instead of its market return of 0.96% and the HD monthly return to be 1% instead of its equilibrium return of 1.05%. Joanna also believes that the expected returns on all other assets other than GM and HD are correct. How can we reflect Joanna ’ s opinions?

Suppose further 323 The Black-Litterman Approach to Portfolio Optimization that she realizes that her two opinions reflect both on each other (i.e., that δ GM influences the return on HD and vice versa) and on all the other returns.

There is, of course, no “scientific” answer to this question. Do You Believe Your Opinions? Do we really believe our own opinions? Do we actually have confidence in what we believe? There is a whole theory of Bayesian adjustments to our beliefs, which is explained in Theil (1971). 6 An application to portfolio model- ing can be found in Black and Litterman (1999) and other associated papers. This author finds these papers dauntingly complicated and difficult to imple-ment. A simpler approach to the confidence question is to form a portfolio based on a convex combination of the market weights and the opinion-adjusted weights: Portfolio proportions Market weights Opinion adjuste=− () ∗ +∗1γ γ - dd weights where γ is our degree of confidence in our opinions. An application to our last example is given below: 6.

Given these assumptions the expected returns on the five-index portfolio are given in cells B29:B33.

If we believe that the world portfolio is efficient (and in the absence of further information, there is little reason to believe otherwise), then the anticipated returns from each of its components are given by the Black-Litterman model, by the risk-free rate, and by an additional assumption on expected returns (in our case: the expected return of the S&P 500 index). The exercises to this chapter explore some other variations to the latter assumption. 13.7 Summary Applying portfolio theory is not merely a matter of using historical market data to derive covariances and expected returns. Blindly applying sample data to derive optimal portfolios (as in section 13.1) usually leads to absurd results. The Black-Litterman approach gets around these absurdities by first assuming that—in the absence of analyst opinions and other information—the bench-mark market weights and current risk-free interest rate correctly predict the future asset returns. The resulting asset returns can then be adjusted for opin-ions and confidence in opinions to derive an optimal portfolio. 329 The Black-Litterman Approach to Portfolio Optimization Exercises 1.

An event study is an attempt to determine whether a particular event in the capital market or in the life of a company affected a company ’ s stock market performance. The event-study methodology aims to separate company-specific events from market- and/or industry-specific events, and has often been used as evidence for or against market efficiency. An event study aims to determine if an event or announcement caused an abnormal movement in a company ’ s stock price. The abnormal returns (AR) are calculated as the difference between a stock ’ s actual return and its expected return, where the stock ’ s expected return is typically measured using the market model, which relies only on a stock ’ s market index to estimate its expected return. 1 Using the market model, we can measure the correlation between an individual stock ’ s returns and its corresponding market returns. In some cases, we sum the abnormal returns to arrive at the cumulative abnormal return (CAR), which measures the total impact of an event through a particular time period, also called the event window. 14.2 Outline of an Event Study In this section we outline the methodology of an event study. In succeeding sections we apply the methodology to a number of different cases. An event study is composed of three time frames: the estimation window (sometimes referred to as the control period), the e vent window , and the post- event window . The following chart illustrates these time frames. * This chapter was co-authored with Dr. Torben V oetmann, Principal at the Brattle Group ( Torben. V oetmann@brattle.com ) and adjunct professor at the University of San Francisco. 1. Abnormal returns are also referred to as residual returns and both terms are used interchange- ably throughout the chapter. 332 Chapter 14 The time line illustrates the timing sequence of an event. The length of the estimation window is represented as T 0 to T 1 . The event occurs at time 0 and the event window is represented as T 1 + 1 to T 2 . The length of the post-event window is represented as T 2 + 1 to T 3 . An event is defined as a point in time when a company makes an announce- ment or when a significant market event occurs. For example, if we are study- ing the impact of mergers and acquisitions on the stock market, the announcement date is normally the point of interest. If we are examining how the market reacts to earnings restatements, the event window begins on the event date when a company announces its restatement. In practice, it is common to expand the event window to 2 trading days, the event date and the following trading day. This is done to capture the market movement if the event was announced immediately before the market closed or after market closing. The event window often starts a few trading days before the actual event day. The length of the event window is centered on the announcement and is normally 3, 5, or 10. This enables us to investigate pre-event leakage of information. The estimation window is also used to determine the normal behavior of a stock ’ s return with respect to a market or industry index. The estimation of the stock ’ s return in the estimation window requires us to define a model of “normal” behavior: Most often we use a regression model for this purpose. 2 T0 T1 T1 + 1 0 T2 T2 T 1 + 3 Start date for estimation windowEnd date for estimation windowStart date for event windowEvent dateEnd date for event windowStart date for post-event windowEnd date for post-event windowTHE EVENT STUDY TIME LINE ESTIMATION WINDOW The estimation window is used to determine the normal behavior of the stock wrt market factors. Most often we use the regression Rit= α+ βRmtto determine this \"normal\" behavior.EVENT WINDOW We use data from this window, in conjunction with the αand βof the stock or stocks to determine whether: i) The event announcement was anticipated or leaked. ii) The \"post-announcement effect\": How long it took for the event information to be absorbed by the market.POST-EVENT WINDOW Used to investigate longer-term company performance following the event. 2. The regression model is similar to the first-pass regression discussed in Chapter 11. See further discussion below. 333 Event Studies The usual length of the estimation window is 252 trading days (or 1 calendar year), but you may not always have this many days in your sample. If not, you need to determine whether the number of observations you do have is sufficient to produce robust results. As a guideline, you should have a minimum of 126 observations; if you have less than 126 observations in the estimation window it is possible that the parameters of the market model will not indicate the true stock price movements, and thus the relationship between the stock returns and the market returns. The estimation window that you select is supposedly a period that was free of any problems, i.e., a period that reflects the stock ’ s normal price movements. 3 The post-event window is most often used to investigate the performance of a company following announcements such as a major acquisition or an IPO. The post-event window allows us to measure the longer-term impact of the event. The post-event window can be as short as 1 month and as long as several years depending on the event. Measuring the Stock ’ s Behavior in the Estimation Window and the Event Window As its name implies, the estimation window is used to estimate a model of the stock ’ s returns under “normal” circumstances. The most common model used for this purpose is the market model, which is essentially a regression of the company ’ s stock returns and the returns of the market index. 4 The market model for a stock i can be expressed as: rrit i i Mt=+αβ Here r i t and r M t represent the stock and the market return on day t . The coef- ficients α i and β i are estimated by running an ordinary least-square regression over the estimation window. The most common criteria for selecting market and/or industry indices are whether the company is listed on NYSE/AMEX or Nasdaq and whether any restrictions are imposed by data availability. In general, the market index 3. Of course something will always be going on in such a long window—quarterly earnings announcements, dividend announcements, news about the companies being considered, etc. Our assumption is that these other events constitute at most “noise” and are not material for the event being studied. 4. Financial economists most often use the market model to estimate the expected return of a security, although they sometimes use the market-adjusted model or the two-factor market model. See an example of the two-factor model in section 14.3. 334 Chapter 14 should be a broad-based value-weighted index or a float-weighted index. The industry index should be specific to the company being analyzed. For litigation purposes, it is common to construct the industry index instead of using alterna-tive S&P 500 or MSCI indices. Most industry indices are available from Yahoo. 5 Given the equation r it = α i + β i r Mt in the estimation window, we can now measure the impact of an event on the stock ’ s return in the event window. For a particular day t in the event window, we define the stock ’ s abnormal return as the difference between its actual return and its predicted return: AR r r it it i i Mt =− + ↑ Actual stock return in event window day t/verticalbracerightαβ(() ↑ ′Return predicted by the stock s and market returnα β, ,/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext We interpret the abnormal return during the event window as a measure of the impact the event had on the market value of the security. This assumes that the event is exogenous with respect to the change in the security ’ s market value. The cumulative abnormal return is a measure of the total abnormal returns during the event window. CAR t is the sum of all the abnormal returns from the beginning of the event window T 1 until a particular day t in the window: CAR AR tT j jt = + =∑ 1 1 Market-Adjusted and Two-Factor Models As mentioned above, you can use several alternative models to calculate a security ’ s expected return. The market-adjusted model is simplest in design and is often used to get a first impression of stock price movements. When using the market-adjusted model, you calculate the abnormal return by taking the difference between the actual return of the security and the actual return 5. Yahoo is probably not the best source for index data (though it is free!). A widely used source for industry data is Bloomberg. A wonderful free source of industry portfolio data is available from Fama-French at http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html . 335 Event Studies of the market index. Thus, there is no need to run ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions to estimate parameters. In fact, all you need is the returns at the time of the event. However, when testing the abnormal returns for statistical significance, you still need to gather returns for the estimation period. The two-factor model utilizes the returns from the market and the industry. You calculate a stock ’ s expected return using parameters from a regression of the actual returns against the market and industry returns during the estimation period. The industry returns are included primarily to account for industry-specific information in addition to the market-specific information. To calcu-late the abnormal return you subtract from the actual return the portion that can be explained by the intercept, the market, and the industry. The two-factor model is illustrated in detail in section 14.3. As Brown and Warner (1985) showed, the results in a large sample of events are not especially sensitive to your choice of estimation model. 6 However, if you are dealing with a small sample you should explore alternative models. 14.3 An Initial Event Study: Procter & Gamble Buys Gillette On 28 January 2005, Procter & Gamble announced a bid for Gillette Company. As can be seen from the press release on page 341, the bid valued Gillette at a premium of 18% over its market price. As might be expected, the bid had a dramatic effect on Gillette ’ s stock price: 6.

To do this, we first determine the estimation window as the 252 trading days preceding the 2 days before the announcement on 28 January 2005: 337 Event Studies 1 23 4 56 7 8 9 10111213 14 15 258 259 260261 262263 264 265266267268 269 270271272 273 274275276277 278 279280281282 283 284285286287 288 289290291292 293 294AB C D E F G 7 0 0 0 . 0 t p e c r e t n I <-- =INTERCEPT($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) 4 6 3 6 . 0 e p o lS <-- =SLOPE($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) R-squared 0.1315 <-- =RSQ($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) 3 1 1 0 . 0 x y e tS <-- =STEYX($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) Days in estimation window 252 <-- =COUNT(A11:A262) Date NYSE GilletteExpected returnAbnormal return (AR)Cumulative abnormal return (CAR ) 27-Jan-04 -0.48% -0.42% 28-Jan-04 -1.26% -1.27% 29-Jan-04 0.00% -0.94% 30-Jan-04 -0.06% -1.39% 2-Feb-04 0.26% -0.74% 19-Jan-05 -0.78% -0.09% 20-Jan-05 -0.69% -0.56% 21-Jan-05 -0.20% -1.50% 24-Jan-05 -0.18% 0.57% 25-Jan-05 0.21% 1.44% 26-Jan-05 0.68% 0.07% 0.50% -0.44% -0.44% <-- =E263 27-Jan-05 0.04% 1.89% 0.09% 1.80% 1.36% <-- =F263+E264 28-Jan-05 -0.24% 12.94% -0.09% 13.03% 14.39% <-- =F264+E265 31-Jan-05 0.82% -1.71% 0.59% -2.30% 12.09% 1-Feb-05 0.80% -0.83% 0.57% -1.40% 10.69% 2-Feb-05 0.32% 0.80% 0.27% 0.52% 11.21% 3-Feb-05 -0.29% -0.59% 4-Feb-05 0.97% -1.29% 7-Feb-05 -0.23% -0.38% 8-Feb-05 0.09% -0.75% 9-Feb-05 -0.63% -1.20% 10-Feb-05 0.68% 0.37% 11-Feb-05 0.71% 1.58% 14-Feb-05 0.26% 0.67% 15-Feb-05 0.32% 1.68% 16-Feb-05 0.04% -0.41% 17-Feb-05 -0.47% 0.18% 18-Feb-05 0.21% 0.10% 22-Feb-05 -1.05% -1.82% 23-Feb-05 0.45% 2.05% 24-Feb-05 0.55% 0.81% 25-Feb-05 1.08% 0.57% 28-Feb-05 -0.55% -2.33% 1-Mar-05 0.41% 1.19%EVENT WINDOW Cell D263 contains formula =$B$2+$B$3*B263 Cell E263 contains formula =C263- D263GILLETTE RETURNS: ESTIMATION WINDOW AND EVENT WINDOW -4%-2%0%2%4%6%8%10%12%14%16%26jan0527jan0528jan0531jan051feb052feb05 Expected return Abnormal return (AR) Cumulative abnormal return (CAR) 338 Chapter 14 The regression results indicate the normal behavior of Gillette in the estima- tion window: r Gillette,t = 0.0007 + 0.6364 r NYSE,t . The Steyx function measures the standard error of the regression-predicted y -values. Below we show how to use this value to measure the significance of the event ’ s abnormal returns. The Event Window We define the event window as 2 days before and 3 days after the announce- ment. To measure the impact of the announcement effect in the event window we use the market model r Gillette ,t = 0.0007 + 0.6346 r NYSE , t . The formulas in the event window are in the spreadsheet above. As you can see, the announcement of the acquisition of Gillette by Procter & Gamble led to several large Gillette abnormal returns in the event window. We can use Steyx , the standard error of the regression prediction to measure the significance of the abnormal returns. Only two of the abnormal returns—on the event date 28 January and the day following—are actually significant at the 5% level: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112 13 14 15 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265266 267 268 269AB C D E F G H I 7 0 0 0 . 0 t p e c r e t n I <-- =INTERCEPT($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) 4 6 3 6 . 0 e p o lS <-- =SLOPE($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) R-squared 0.1315 <-- =RSQ($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) 3 1 1 0 . 0 x y e tS <-- =STEYX($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) Days in estimationwindow 252 <-- =COUNT(A11:A262) Date NYSE GilletteAbnormal return (AR)AR t-testAR significant? 27-Jan-04 -0.48% -0.42% 28-Jan-04 -1.26% -1.27% 29-Jan-04 0.00% -0.94% 30-Jan-04 -0.06% -1.39% 2-Feb-04 0.26% -0.74% 19-Jan-05 -0.78% -0.09% 20-Jan-05 -0.69% -0.56% 21-Jan-05 -0.20% -1.50% 24-Jan-05 -0.18% 0.57% 25-Jan-05 0.21% 1.44% 26-Jan-05 0.68% 0.07% -0.44% -0.39 no 27-Jan-05 0.04% 1.89% 1.80% 1.59 no 28-Jan-05 -0.24% 12.94% 13.03% 11.56 yes 31-Jan-05 0.82% -1.71% -2.30% -2.04 yes 1-Feb-05 0.80% -0.83% -1.40% -1.24 no 2-Feb-05 0.32% 0.80% 0.52% 0.46 no 3-Feb-05 -0.29% -0.59%Cell F263 contains formula =IF(ABS(E263)<1.96,\"no\",\"yes\")EVENT WINDOWGILLETTE RETURNS: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ABNORMAL RETURNS Cell D263 contains formula =C263-($B$2+$B$3*B263) Cell E263 contains formula =D263/$B$5 339 Event Studies We calculate the test statistic by dividing the abnormal returns by the Steyx in cell B5. Assuming that the regression residuals are normally distributed, if the absolute value of the test statistic is larger than 1.96, then the abnormal return is significant at the 95% level (meaning that the chances that the abnor-mal return is random and insignificant are less than 5%). If the test statistic is larger than 2.58, its significance level is 1%. As can be seen from rows 263–268 above, at the 1% level, only the announcement itself has a significant abnormal return. 7 What About Procter & Gamble? Thus far we have concentrated on the event influence on the takeover target, Gillette. Applying the same methodology to Procter & Gamble ’ s stock returns shows that the announcement had a negative impact on its stock returns. There may also have been some leakage of the information prior to the announcement on 28 January 2005: 7. One limitation of Steyx is that the variance is slightly understated. The true variance of the market model is the estimation variance from Steyx and the additional variance due to the sam- pling error in α i and β i . However, the sampling error approaches zero as the length of the estima- tion window increases. Since we suggest using 252 trading days in the estimation window, the effect of the sampling error is minimal and it is, therefore, often disregarded when calculating the variance of the abnormal returns. 340 Chapter 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 258 259 260 261 262 263 264265 266 267 268 269270 271 272273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291AB C D E F G H 4 0 0 0 . 0 t p e c r e t n I <-- =INTERCEPT($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) 7 7 8 5 . 0 e p o lS <-- =SLOPE($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) R-squared 0.1872 <-- =RSQ($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) 4 8 0 0 . 0 x y e tS <-- =STEYX($C$11:$C$262,$B$11:$B$262) Days in estimationwindow 252 <-- =COUNT(A11:A262) Date NYSE Procter-GambleAbnormal return (AR)AR t-testAR significant?Cumulative abnormal return 27-Jan-04 -0.48% -0.65% 28-Jan-04 -1.26% -0.56% 29-Jan-04 0.00% 2.41% 30-Jan-04 -0.06% 0.08% 2-Feb-04 0.26% 0.59% 19-Jan-05 -0.78% 1.69% 20-Jan-05 -0.69% 0.04% 21-Jan-05 -0.20% -1.85% 24-Jan-05 -0.18% -0.79% 25-Jan-05 0.21% 0.94% 26-Jan-05 0.68% -0.52% -0.96% -1.14 no -0.96% <-- =D263 27-Jan-05 0.04% -0.22% -0.28% -0.33 no -1.25% <-- =G263+D264 28-Jan-05 -0.24% -2.12% -2.02% -2.39 yes -3.26% <-- =G264+D265 31-Jan-05 0.82% -1.70% -2.23% -2.64 yes -5.49% 1-Feb-05 0.80% -0.68% -1.19% -1.41 no -6.67% 2-Feb-05 0.32% 1.00% 0.77% 0.91 no -5.90% 3-Feb-05 -0.29% -0.30% 4-Feb-05 0.97% -1.16% 7-Feb-05 -0.23% -0.17% 8-Feb-05 0.09% -1.05% 9-Feb-05 -0.63% -0.90% 10-Feb-05 0.68% 0.21% 11-Feb-05 0.71% 1.03% 14-Feb-05 0.26% 1.05% 15-Feb-05 0.32% 1.48% 16-Feb-05 0.04% -0.32% 17-Feb-05 -0.47% 0.04% 18-Feb-05 0.21% 0.32% 22-Feb-05 -1.05% -2.34% 23-Feb-05 0.45% 2.37% 24-Feb-05 0.55% 0.64% 25-Feb-05 1.08% 0.67% 28-Feb-05 -0.55% -2.03% 1-Mar-05 0.41% 0.79%Cell F263 contains formula =IF(ABS(E263)<1.96,\"no\",\"yes\")PROCTER & GAMBLE RETURNS: ESTIMATION WINDOW AND EVENT WINDOW EVENT WINDOW Cell D263 contains formula =C263-($B$2+$B$3*B263) Cell E263 contains formula =D263/$B$5 -7%-6%-5%-4%-3%-2%-1%0%1%26-Jan 27-Jan 28-Jan 31-Jan 01-Feb 02-Feb Abnormal return (AR) Cumulative abnormal return 341 Event Studies Summarizing: What Happened on the Announcement Date? On 28 January 2005, Procter & Gamble announced the purchase of Gillette. Each share of Gillette was purchased for 0.975 shares of Procter & Gamble. At the 5% significance level, the acquisition announcement had significant effects on the stock prices of Gillette and Procter & Gamble only on the announcement date and the day after. After an initial positive impact on Gillette (a 13.03% increase in the normally anticipated stock return on the event date 28 January and a further − 2.30% on 31 January) and an initial negative impact on Procter & Gamble ( − 2.02% on 28 January and − 2.23% on 31 January), there were no additional significant effects on the stock prices around the announcement. The cumulative effects are summarized below: 342 Chapter 14 The table above attempts to measure the short-term synergies of the announcement by multiplying the CAR for Gillette and P&G times their market value on the day before the event window. In the short period of time measured by this event window, the cumulative synergy appears to be negative, with the positive value creation for Gillette shareholders outweighed by the negative impact on P&G. 8 14.4 A Fuller Event Study: Impact of Earnings Announcements on Stock Prices In the previous section we used the event-study methodology to explore the impact of a merger announcement on the returns of both the takeover target (Gillette) and acquirer (Procter & Gamble). In this section we show how to aggregate the returns of an event in order to evaluate the market response to a particular type of event. We consider the effect of earning announcements on a set of stores in the grocery industry. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17AB C D E F G H I Shares outstanding (thousands)Share price, 25jan05Market value, 25jan05 (billion $ ) Gillette 1,000,000 44.53 44.53 P&G 2,741,000 53.49 146.62 Date Gillette P&G Sum Gillette P&G Sum 26-Jan-05 -0.44% -0.96% -1.40% -0.19 -1.41 -1.61 <-- =F12+G12 27-Jan-05 1.80% -0.28% 1.52% 0.61 -1.83 -1.22 28-Jan-05 13.03% -2.02% 11.01% 6.41 -4.78 1.63 31-Jan-05 -2.30% -2.23% -4.52% 5.38 -8.04 -2.66 1-Feb-05 -1.40% -1.19% -2.59% 4.76 -9.78 -5.02 2-Feb-05 0.52% 0.77% 1.29% 4.99 -8.66 -3.66GILLETTE PURCHASED BY PROCTER & GAMBLE Measuring the synergies in event window Abnormal returns (AR)Cumulative abnormal valuations (billion $)Cell G12 contains formula =$D$4*SUM($C$12:C12)/1000Cell F12 contains formula =$D$3*SUM($B$12:B12)/1000 8. A study commissioned by the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William F. Galvin after the merger offer suggests that the synergies of the merger, between $22 and $28 billion, were largely captured by Procter & Gamble.

On this date Safeway announced earnings per share (EPS) of $0.42, a number which exceeded by 6 cents the market consensus estimate of $0.36. 9 On the same day, the S&P 500 declined by 0.85%, and Safeway stock rose by 8.39%. The spreadsheet below shows the example of Safeway ’ s earnings announcement on 20 July 2006. We use the event-study methodology to gauge the market reaction to this earnings surprise: 1 2 3 456 7 89 10 11 12 131415 16 1718 19C B A 6 0 - l u J - 0 2 e t a d t n e m e c n u o n n A 2 4 . 0 $ e r a h s r e p s g n i n r a E 6 3 . 0 $ e t a m i t s e s g n i n r a e s u s n e s n o C Earnings surprise (forecast error) $0.06 % 9 3 . 8 y a w e f a S % 5 8 . 0 - 0 0 5 P & S 1 0 0 0 . 0 t p e c r e t n I 9 8 2 9 . 0 e p o l S 8 1 1 0 . 0 x y e t S 2 1 B + 9 B * 3 1 B = - - < % 8 7 . 0 - n r u t e r d e t c e p x E 7 1 B - 8 B = - - < % 7 1 . 9 n r u t e r l a u d i s e R 5 7 . 7 c i t s i t a t s - t <-- =B18/B14The residual return: Expected stock returns versus actual returnsHow did the market interpret the earnings surprise?

The regression shows that r Safeway = 0.0001 + 0.9289* r S & P 500 and that the standard error of the estimate is 0.0118. Given these data, we can see that on the day of the announcement the anticipated return of Safeway, given the negative 0.85% return of the S&P and absent the earnings surprise, should have been − 0.78%. This means that the abnormal return, measuring the impact of the earnings announcement, was 9. Yahoo is the source of our earnings surprise data (see below). 344 Chapter 14 9.17% (cell B18, above). The t -statistic for the return was 7.75, showing that it is highly significant.

While Yahoo is an admirable source of data, it does not provide a database of historical analyst estimates and actual earnings numbers; such data are available from Bloomberg ’ s Best Consensus Earnings Estimates and other commercial sources. 345 Event Studies An Event Study: The Grocery Industry We extend our Safeway study by considering 16 quarterly earnings announce- ments by four grocery companies for fiscal year 2006. 10 1 2 345 6 789 101112 13 141516171819 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27AB C D E F G H I J K LM N OP Q Calendar Date Ticker Consensus Actual Surprise: =D3-C3Starting PointIntercept Slope STEXYActual ReturnS&P 500 ReturnExpected Return: =H3+I3*M3Abnormal Return: =L3-N3t-stat 7-Mar-06 KR 0.36 0.39 0.03 44 0.0003 0.6662 0.0123 1.36% -0.19% -0.09% 1.46% 1.1808 <-- =O3/J3 20-Jun-06 KR 0.42 0.42 0.00 117 0.0004 0.6063 0.0113 5.05% 0.00% 0.04% 5.01% 4.4355 <-- =O4/J4 12-Sep-06 KR 0.29 0.29 0.00 175 0.0006 0.5628 0.0108 -5.67% 1.03% 0.64% -6.31% -5.8201 <-- =O5/J5 5-Dec-06 KR 0.28 0.30 0.02 234 0.0003 0.4483 0.0118 5.08% 0.40% 0.21% 4.87% 4.1297 18-Apr-06 SVU 0.56 0.55 -0.01 73 -0.0008 0.7049 0.0123 -0.28% 1.69% 1.11% -1.39% -1.1313 26-Jul-06 SVU 0.57 0.53 -0.04 142 -0.0003 0.5416 0.0122 -7.09% -0.04% -0.05% -7.03% -5.7632 10-Oct-06 SVU 0.53 0.61 0.08 195 -0.0002 0.6014 0.0128 4.36% 0.20% 0.10% 4.26% 3.3170 9-Jan-07 SVU 0.56 0.54 -0.02 256 0.0003 0.5238 0.0130 -1.70% -0.05% 0.00% -1.70% -1.3061 27-Apr-06 SWY 0.30 0.32 0.02 80 0.0001 1.0139 0.0130 2.88% 0.33% 0.34% 2.54% 1.9473 20-Jul-06 SWY 0.36 0.42 0.06 138 0.0001 0.9289 0.0118 8.39% -0.85% -0.78% 9.17% 7.7519 12-Oct-06 SWY 0.39 0.39 0.00 197 0.0003 0.7533 0.0134 -1.43% 0.95% 0.75% -2.18% -1.6265 27-Feb-07 SWY 0.60 0.61 0.01 289 0.0012 0.7505 0.0131 -3.95% -3.53% -2.54% -1.41% -1.0814 4-May-06 WFMI 0.35 0.36 0.01 85 0.0006 0.8345 0.0175 12.50% 0.32% 0.33% 12.17% 6.9434 1-Aug-06 WFMI 0.34 0.35 0.01 146 -0.0007 1.2329 0.0164 -12.51% -0.45% -0.63% -11.88% -7.2345 3-Nov-06 WFMI 0.29 0.29 0.00 213 -0.0014 1.3199 0.0195 -26.21% -0.22% -0.43% -25.78% -13.2186 22-Feb-07 WFMI 0.40 0.38 -0.02 286 -0.0020 1.5321 0.0243 13.13% -0.09% -0.33% 13.46% 5.5465 Positive surprise2.65% Non-positive surprise-3.24%EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT IN 2006-07 FOR KROGER (KR), SUPERVALU (SVU), SAFEWAY (SWY), AND WHOLE FOODS (WFMI) Cell G18 contains formula: =COUNTIF('Stock Prices'!$A$3:$A$551,\"<=\"&TEXT(A18,\"0\"))-252 Cell H18 contains formula: =INTERCEPT(OFFSET('Stock Prices'!$A$2,$G18,10,252,1),OFFSET('Stock Prices'!$A$2,$G18,2,252,1)) Cell J18 contains formula: =STEYX(OFFSET('Stock Prices'!$A$2,$G18,10,252,1),OFFSET('Stock Prices'!$A$2,$G18,2,252,1))Cell I18 contains formula: =SLOPE(OFFSET('Stock Prices'!$A$2,$G18,10,252,1),OFFSET('Stock Prices'!$A$2,$G18,2,252,1))<-- =SUMIF($E$3:$E$18,\">0\",$O$3:$O$18)/COUNTIF(E3:E18,\">0\") <-- =SUMIF($E$3:$E$18,\"<=0\",$O$3:$O $18 )/COUNTIF (E3:E18,\"<=0\" ) For each announcement we have determined the intercept and slope of the market-model regression for the 252 days preceding the announcement. 11 Here ’ s a specific example from the above spreadsheet: 2 3 18AB C D E F G H I J K LM N OP Calendar Date Ticker Consensus Actual Surprise: =D3-C3Starting PointIntercept Slope STEXYActual ReturnS&P 500 ReturnExpected Return: =H3+I3*M3Abnormal Return: =L3-N3T-stat 7-Mar-06 KR 0.36 0.39 0.03 44 0.0003 0.6662 0.0123 1.36% -0.19% -0.09% 1.46% 1.1808 22-Feb-07 WFMI 0.40 0.38 -0.02 286 -0.0020 1.5321 0.0243 13.13% -0.09% -0.33% 13.46% 5.5465 10. We included only Kroger, Supervalu, Safeway, and Whole Foods in the sample. This is obvi- ously an incomplete sample, both in terms of the firms covered and the number of announcements. However, this extended example is meant to impart the flavor of a full-bodied event study. 11. The event window is defined in column G by the “Starting point,” which uses Countif to locate a date 252 business days before the event date in the data base of stock returns. Notice that the “Starting point” is used in the Intercept , Slope , Rsq formulas in columns H, I, and J. 346 Chapter 14 Row 3 tracks the market model of Kroger stock to the S&P 500 in the 252 trading days before the earnings announcement on 7 March 2006. The market model is r Safeway = 0.0001 + 0.9289* r S & P 500 . Kroger ’ s actual return on the announcement date, 1.36%, is 1.46% higher than the return which would have been predicted by its market model. However, dividing this 1.46% by the standard deviation of the abnormal returns (the regression residuals) ( Steyx = 0.0123) gives a t -statistic of 1.1808, which is not significant at the 5% level. Row 18 tracks the market model of Whole Foods stock to the S&P 500 in the year before the earnings announcement after market close on 21 February 2007. The market model is r Safeway = 0.0001 + 0.9289* r S & P 500 , with Steyx = 0.0243. The abnormal return on the day of the announcement, 13.46%, is significant at the 1% level (hence the boldface in cell P18). To temper this interpretation, note that on the day of the earnings announcement, Whole Foods announced the merger with Wild Oats Markets; this makes it difficult to interpret the true market reaction to the earnings release. In general, we have to be careful interpreting abnormal returns when an event is announced with confounding information. The Cumulative Abnormal Returns We restate the data in slightly different form in the spreadsheet below—using the Offset function—and then compute the abnormal returns in an event window which goes from − 10 to + 10 days around the earnings announcements: 347 Event Studies We can compute the average abnormal return (AAR) and cumulative abnor- mal return (CAR) for each of the days in the event window. In the following table we perform this computation separately for positive versus non-positive earnings announcements: 1 2 3 456 7 8 9 10 1112 13 14 15 16 171819 20 2122 23 242526 27 282930 31 3233 34

average, there appears to have been little leakage prior to the announce- ment date of neither the good news announcements nor the bad news. The market appears to have absorbed the information in the announcements rapidly—following the announcement date (“event day 0”), there appears to have been little additional response. 350 Chapter 14 14.5 Using a Two-Factor Model of Returns for an Event Study The model used in section 14.2 assumes an equilibrium model r it = α i + β i r Mt . This so-called “one factor” model assumes that the returns on the stocks in question are driven only by one market index. In this section we illustrate a two-factor model. We assume that returns are a function of both a market and an industry factor: r it = α i + β i , Market r Mt + β i , Industry r Industry , t . We then use this model to determine if a specific event influenced the returns and in which direction. Our event: On 16 November 2006, Wendy ’ s announced the purchase by tender of 22,418,000 shares at a price of $35.75 per share. This share purchase represented approximately 19% of the firm ’ s equity. Wendy ’ s stock closed on 16 November at $35.66. 351 Event Studies Did the Repurchase Affect Wendy ’ s Returns? We start by regressing the daily returns on Wendy ’ s on the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Restaurant Index for the 252 days preceding the tender date of 16 November 2006. We use the array function Linest to do this computation. 12 The Linest box looks like: 12. The use of Linest to perform multiple regressions is discussed in Chapter 33. It is not the most user friendly of Excel functions. 352 Chapter 14 (Note that the #N/A above is produced by Excel and simply means that there is no entry for this column.) From this box we can conclude that Wendy ’ s return is sensitive to both the market and the industry. rWendys t , ...=+ ↑0 0012 0 5095 Market reaction coefficient Standard d errorIndustry reaction coefficient : .. 0 14100 4157/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/dncurlybracketright∗+ ↑rMt .. : ., Standard error 0 0851/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/dncurlybracketright∗rIndustry t This Linest box is shown again (see following). Dividing the coefficients by their respective standard errors (row 9) shows that they are both significant at the 1% level. Note that cell C4 gives the standard error of the y -estimate; we use this in the analysis to determine the significance of the abnormal returns.

While there is little AR or CAR on the days before the announcement, it is clear that the announcement on 16 November had a considerable impact on Wendy ’ s returns on the day following ( − 5.87% abnor- mal return on 17 November) and on the next day ( − 1.61% AR on 20 Novem- ber). Dividing the abnormal return by the standard error in C5 shows that only the AR on the event day is significant at the 5% level. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 263264265 266 267 268 269270 271 272273 274 275276 277 278279 280 281282 283 284285 286 287 288 289290 291 292293 294 295296 297AB C D E F G H I J Industry Market Intercept 7 5 1 4 . 0 > - - e p o l S 0.5095 0.0012 Standard Error --> 0.0851 0.1410 0.0007 R2 --> 0.3140 0.0103 #N/A F statistic --> 56.9738 94 2 #N/A SSxy --> 0.0122 0.0266 #N/A 8 1 8 8 . 4 t a t s -t 3.6142 1.8367 <-- =D3/D4 Days in estimation window 252 <-- =COUNT(A15:A266) Date Wendy's Intl S&P 500 S&P 500 Restaurant IndexExpected returnAbnormal return (AR)Cumulative abnormal return (CAR)T-test of AR 15-Nov-05 0.08% -0.39% -1.26% 16-Nov-05 -0.37% 0.18% -0.93% 17-Nov-05 0.84% 0.94% 1.60% 18-Nov-05 0.27% 0.44% 0.19% 21-Nov-05 1.08% 0.53% 0.92% 9-Nov-06 -0.89% -0.53% -0.35% 10-Nov-06 1.46% 0.19% 0.95% 13-Nov-06 0.08% 0.25% -0.05% 14-Nov-06 0.73% 0.63% 0.03% 15-Nov-06 0.25% 0.24% 0.21% 0.33% -0.08% -0.08% <-- =F267 -0.0741 <-- =F267/$C$5 16-Nov-06 0.31% 0.23% 1.26% 0.76% -0.45% -0.53% <-- =G267+F268 -0.4363 17-Nov-06 -6.44% 0.10% -1.78% -0.57% -5.87% -6.40% <-- =G268+F269 -5.6805 2 8 5 5 . 1 - % 1 0 . 8 - % 1 6 . 1 - % 2 0 . 0 % 9 1 . 0 - % 5 0 . 0 - % 9 5 . 1 - 6 0 - v o N - 0 2 4 8 7 0 . 0 - % 9 0 . 8 - % 8 0 . 0 - % 3 2 . 0 % 7 0 . 0 % 6 1 . 0 % 5 1 . 0 6 0 - v o N - 1 2 22-Nov-06 2.80% 0.23% 0.27% 0.35% 2.45% -5.64% 2/7/20052/8/20052/9/2005 2/10/20052/11/20052/14/2005 2/15/2005 2/16/20052/17/2005 2/18/2005 2/22/20052/23/2005 2/24/2005 2/25/2005 2/28/2005 3/1/2005WENDY'S RETURNS: ESTIMATION WINDOW AND EVENT WINDOW Cell F267 contains formula =B267- E267Cell E267 contains formula =$D$3+$C$3*C267+$B$3*D267Cells B3:D7 contain the array formula {=LINEST(B15:B266,C15:D266,,TRUE)} Cell C5 is the standard error of the y estimate, used in the t-test of the abnormal returns EVENT WINDOW -10%-8%-6%-4%-2%0%2%4% 15nov06 16nov06 17nov06 20nov06 21nov06 22nov06 Expected return Abnormal return (AR) Cumulative abnormal return (CAR) 354 Chapter 14 Furthermore, an analysis of the announcement broken down into the market and the industry factors shows that on both of the 2 days after the 16 November announcement date the effects of the market index on Wendy ’ s returns were slight. On 17 November, however, there was a significant impact of the S&P 500 Restaurant Index on Wendy ’ s which was lacking on 20 November. To see this, we first discuss the day after the event, 17 November 2006: 13 14 266 267 268 269 270271 272AB C D E F G H Date Wendy's Intl S&P 500 S&P 500 Restaurant IndexExpected returnAbnormal return (AR)Cumulative abnormal return (CAR) 14-Nov-06 0.73% 0.63% 0.03% 15-Nov-06 0.25% 0.24% 0.21% 0.33% -0.08% -0.08% <-- =F267 16-Nov-06 0.31% 0.23% 1.26% 0.76% -0.45% -0.53% <-- =G267+F268 17-Nov-06 -6.44% 0.10% -1.78% -0.57% -5.87% -6.40% <-- =G268+F269 20-Nov-06 -1.59% -0.05% -0.19% 0.02% -1.61% -8.01% 21-Nov-06 0.15% 0.16% 0.07% 0.23% -0.08% -8.09% 22-Nov-06 2.80% 0.23% 0.27% 0.35% 2.45% -5.64%EVENT WINDOW On 17 November, the S&P 500 rose by 0.10% and the S&P 500 Restaurant Index fell by 1.78%.

But Wendy ’ s decreased by − 6.44% on the same day, well in excess of the impact of either of the two factors.

But Wendy ’ s decreased by − 1.59% on the same day, which is again well in excess of the impact of either of the two factors. The impact of the announcement was felt even in the third day after the event, but we leave this analysis to the reader. 14.6 Using Excel ’ s Offset Function to Locate a Regression in a Data Set The analysis in section 14.2 requires us to do a regression of a specific stock ’ s returns on the returns of the S&P 500, where the starting point of the regres-sion is the 252 trading days before a specific date. The technique in section 14.2 uses a number of Excel functions: • The functions Intercept , Slope , Rsq give the regression intercept, slope, and r -squared. These functions have been illustrated in Chapter 2 and in the previous portfolio chapters. The function Steyx gives the standard deviation of the regression residuals. • The function CountIf counts the number of cells in a range which meet a specific condition. CountIf has the syntax CountIf(data,condition) . However , the condition must be a text condition (which means that in this example we will use the Excel function Text to translate a date to a text number—more later). • The function Offset (see also Chapter 33) allows us to specify a cell or a block of cells in an array. To illustrate the problem, consider the following data of returns for General Mills (GIS) and the S&P 500. We want to run a regression of the GIS returns on the S&P 500 returns for 10 dates before 29 January 1997: 356 Chapter 14 To run this regression, we first use CountIf(data,condition) to count the row number of the data on which the starting date falls. Since condition must be a text entry, we translate the date in cell B26 to a text by using Text(b26, ″ 0 ″ ) . The Excel function = CountIf(A3:A24, ″ < = ″ &Text(B26, ″ 0 ″ )) now counts the number of cells in the column A3:A24 which are less than or equal to the date in cell B26. The answer, as you can see in cell B27, is 19. Next, we use Offset(A3:F24,B27-11,2,10,1) to locate the 10 rows of GIS returns before the 19th row indicated by the starting date. This is a tricky function! 1 2 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 1314 15 1617 18 1920 21 2223 24 2526 27 28 29 3031 32 3334 35 3637G F E D C B A DateGeneral Mills GISn r u t e R 0 0 5 P S n r u t e R 3 0 . 8 4 7 6 9 . 7 5 7 9 - n a J - 3 6-Jan-97 58.19 0.0040 <-- =LN(B4/B3) 747.65 -0.0005 <-- =LN(E4/E3) 4 7 0 0 . 0 3 2 . 3 5 7 4 9 1 0 . 0 3 3 . 9 5 7 9 - n a J - 7 4 6 0 0 . 0 - 1 4 . 8 4 7 0 0 0 0 . 0 3 3 . 9 5 7 9 - n a J - 8 6 8 0 0 . 0 5 8 . 4 5 7 7 9 0 0 . 0 1 9 . 9 5 7 9 - n a J - 9 1 6 0 0 . 0 5 . 9 5 7 0 0 0 0 . 0 1 9 . 9 5 7 9 - n a J - 0 1 0 0 0 0 . 0 1 5 . 9 5 7 8 3 0 0 . 0 - 8 6 . 9 5 7 9 - n a J - 3 1 2 2 1 0 . 0 6 8 . 8 6 7 8 3 0 0 . 0 1 9 . 9 5 7 9 - n a J - 4 1 2 2 0 0 . 0 - 2 . 7 6 7 9 5 0 0 . 0 - 6 5 . 9 5 7 9 - n a J - 5 1 3 3 0 0 . 0 5 7 . 9 6 7 0 0 0 0 . 0 6 5 . 9 5 7 9 - n a J - 6 1 3 8 0 0 . 0 7 1 . 6 7 7 0 0 0 0 . 0 6 5 . 9 5 7 9 - n a J - 7 1 7 0 0 0 . 0 7 . 6 7 7 0 2 0 0 . 0 - 4 4 . 9 5 7 9 - n a J - 0 2 7 7 0 0 . 0 2 7 . 2 8 7 1 1 2 0 . 0 1 7 . 0 6 7 9 - n a J - 1 2 5 4 0 0 . 0 3 2 . 6 8 7 3 1 1 0 . 0 4 . 1 6 7 9 - n a J - 2 2 1 1 1 0 . 0 - 6 5 . 7 7 7 2 1 1 0 . 0 9 0 . 2 6 7 9 - n a J - 3 2 1 9 0 0 . 0 - 2 5 . 0 7 7 4 7 0 0 . 0 - 3 6 . 1 6 7 9 - n a J - 4 2 2 7 0 0 . 0 - 2 0 . 5 6 7 5 5 0 0 . 0 - 9 2 . 1 6 7 9 - n a J - 7 2 0 0 0 0 . 0 2 0 . 5 6 7 8 3 0 0 . 0 - 6 0 . 1 6 7 9 - n a J - 8 2 7 9 0 0 . 0 5 . 2 7 7 7 6 1 0 . 0 9 0 . 2 6 7 9 - n a J - 9 2 0 5 1 0 . 0 7 1 . 4 8 7 9 1 0 0 . 0 1 2 . 2 6 7 9 - n a J - 0 3 5 2 0 0 . 0 6 1 . 6 8 7 7 3 0 0 . 0 4 4 . 2 6 7 9 - n a J - 1 3 7 0 0 0 . 0 3 7 . 6 8 7 6 5 0 0 . 0 - 9 0 . 2 6 7 9 - b e F - 3 Starting date 29-Jan-97 Rows from top of data to starting date 19 <-- =COUNTIF(A3:A24,\"<=\"&TEXT(B26,\"0\")) Regression Intercept 0.0022 <-- =INTERCEPT(OFFSET(A3:F24,B27-11,2,10,1),OFFSET(A3:F24,B27-11,5,10,1)) Slope 0.5198 <-- =SLOPE(OFFSET(A3:F24,B27-11,2,10,1),OFFSET(A3:F24,B27-11,5,10,1)) R-squared 0.1413 <-- =RSQ(OFFSET(A3:F24,B27-11,2,10,1),OFFSET(A3:F24,B27-11,5,10,1)) Check Intercept 0.0022 <-- =INTERCEPT(C11:C20,F11:F20) Slope 0.5198 <-- =SLOPE(C11:C20,F11:F20) R-squared 0.1413 <-- =RSQ(C11:C20,F11:F20)USING OFFSET, COUNTIF, AND TEXT TO LOCATE A REGRESSION IN A DATA SET 357 Event Studies Offset A F B Reference arrayStarting row in ref(: , -32 4 2 7 1 1 ↑↑/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext eerence arraycolumns over from top corner of referen/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext,2 2↑ cce array Fix starting corner in reference array from which d/verticalbraceright ↑ aata is consideredrows starting corner /dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/verticalbraceright,,10 10↑ below1 1 1↑ ↑Only column of data Data c onsidered/verticalbraceright /dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext) The functions Intercept , Slope , Rsq can now be used with Offset (A3:F24,B27-11,2,10,1) and Offset(A3:F24,B27-11,5,10,1) : = ↑Intercept Offset A F B y-data(( : , - , , , ) 3 24 27 11 2 10 1/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext /dncurlybracketright /horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext /horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext /dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext /dncurlybracketright /horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext, (: , - , , , ) ) Offset A F B x-data3 2 4 2 7 1 151 01 ↑ 14.7 Summary Event studies, used to determine the impact of a particular market effect on a specific stock or a generic market effect on a set of stocks, are some of the most widely used technologies in practical finance. While Excel may not be the optimal tool for performing an event study, we have used it in this chapter to illustrate both uses of the event study. We have shown that Excel can readily be used to perform either a one-factor or a two-factor event study. The Excel techniques employed are easily acquired by a sophisticated user. III V ALUATION OF OPTIONS Chapters 15–19 deal with option pricing and applications. Chapter 15 is an introduction to options. After defining the option terminology, Chapter 15 discusses option payoffs and basic option arbitrage propositions. In Chapter 16 we discuss the binomial option pricing model and its implementation in Excel. After showing how these binomial models work, we use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to build binomial option pricing functions for both European and American options. One of the applications discussed is the pricing of employee stock options. Chapter 17 discusses the Black-Scholes pricing formulas for European calls and puts. These formulas can be implemented either by direct calculation in the spreadsheet or by using VBA to build new spreadsheet functions. An exten-sion of the Black-Scholes model to the pricing of dividend paying stocks (the so-called Merton model) is implemented. We show how to apply the option pricing models to the valuation of structured securities. Chapter 18 discusses the computation of “Greeks”—the derivatives of the option-pricing formula which show the sensitivities of the option valuation to its various parameters. Chapter 19 discusses real options—the application of the option pricing models to real investments. Once you have mastered the ideas in these chapters, we refer you to the Monte Carlo section of this book. Chapters 24–30 show how option pricing strategies can be simulated in Excel. These chapters also show how more complicated options—whose payments are path dependent—can be priced using Monte Carlo methods. 1 5 Introduction to Options 15.1 Overview In this chapter we give a brief introduction to options. The chapter can, at best, serve as an introduction to the already informed. If you know nothing what-soever about options, read an introduction to the topic in a basic finance text. 1 We start with the basic definitions and options terminology, go on to discuss graphs of option payoffs and “profit diagrams,” and finally discuss some of the more important option arbitrage propositions (sometimes referred to as linear pricing restrictions). In subsequent chapters we discuss two methods of pricing options: The binomial option pricing model (Chapter 16) and the Black-Scholes option pricing model (Chapter 17). 15.2 Basic Option Definitions and Terminology An option on a stock is a security that gives the holder the right to buy or to sell one share of the stock on or before a particular date for a predetermined price. Here is a brief glossary of terms and notation used in the field of options: • Call, C : An option that gives the holder the right to buy a share of stock on or before a given date at a predetermined price. • Put, P : An option that gives the holder the right to sell a share of stock on or before a given date at a predetermined price. • Exercise price, X : The price at which the holder can buy or sell the underly- ing stock; sometimes also referred to as the strike price . • Expiration date, T : The date on or before which the holder can buy or sell the underlying stock. • Stock price, S t : The price at which the underlying stock is selling at date t . The current stock price is denoted S 0 . • Option price : The price at which the option is sold or bought. 1. Good chapters can be found in the following books: John Hull, Options, Futures and Other Derivatives (Prentice Hall, 8th edition, 2011); Zvi Bodie, Alex Kane, and Alan J. Marcus, Invest- ments (McGraw-Hill, 9th edition, 2011). 362 Chapter 15 American versus European options : In the jargon of options markets, an American option is an option which can be exercised on or before the expira- tion date T , whereas a European option is one which can be exercised only on the expiration date T . This terminology is confusing for two reasons: • The options sold on both European and American options exchanges are almost invariably American options. • The simplest option pricing formulas (these include the famous Black- Scholes option pricing formula discussed in Chapter 17) are for European options . As we show in section 15.6, in many cases we can price American options as if they were European options. We use C t to denote the price of a European call on date t , and P t to denote the European put price. If it is clear that the option price refers to today ’ s price, we often drop the subscript, writing C or P instead of C 0 or P 0 . When we need fuller notation, we write C t ( S t ,X,T ) for the price of a call on date t when the price of the underlying stock is S t , the exercise price is X , and the expiration date is T . If we wish to specify that our option pricing formula relates to an American option, we use the superscript A : C C SX T P SX TtA tA ttA t , ( ,, ) ( ,, ) or . When written without superscripts, the options pricing refers to European options. At-the-money , in-the-money , out-of-the-money : If the exercise price X of a call or a put is equal to the current price of the stock S 0 , then the option is at-the-money . If a positive cash flow could be made by immediately exercising an American option (that is, S 0 − X > 0 for a call and X − S 0 > 0 for a put), then the option is in-the-money . 2 Writing Options Versus Purchasing Options: Cash Flows The purchaser of a call option acquires the right to buy a share of stock for a given price on or before date T and pays for this right at the time of purchase. The writer or seller of this call option is the seller of this right: The writer collects the option price today in return for obligating herself to deliver one share of stock in the future for the exercise price, if the purchaser of the call demands. In terms of cash flows, the purchaser of an option always has an 2. It is of course not logical, that you can ever make an immediate profit by buying an American option and immediately exercising it. Thus, for American calls, C 0 > S 0 − X , and for American puts, P 0 > X − S 0 . In-the-money and out-of-the-money refers only to the relation between S 0 and X without taking into account the option price. 363 Introduction to Options initial negative cash flow (the price of the option) and a future cash flow which is at worst zero (if it is not worthwhile exercising the option) and otherwise positive (if the option is exercised). The cash-flow position of the writer of the option is reversed: An initial positive cash flow is followed by a terminal cash flow which is at best zero. T e m i T 0 e m i T Purchase call option, cash flow < 0Terminal call payoff, Max[ ST - X, ] > Cash flows of call buyer Between times and T: Cash flow = 0 for European optionCash flow > 0 for American option Write (I.e., issue) call option,cash flow > 0Pay terminal call payoff- Max[ ST - X, ] < Cash flows of call writer Between times and T: Cash flow = 0 for European option Cash flow < 0 for American optionCall Option Payoff Patterns 000 00 0 A similar payoff pattern holds for the cash flows of the purchaser and writer of a put option on a stock: 364 Chapter 15 T e m i T 0 e m i T Purchase put option, cash flow < 0Terminal put payoff,Max[ X - S T,] > Cash flowsof put buyer Between times and T: Cash flow = 0 for European optionCash flow > 0 for American option Write (I.e., issue) call option,cash flow > 0Pay terminal call payoff- Max[ X - S T, ] < Cash flows of put writer Between times and T: Cash flow = 0 for European optionCash flow < 0 for American optionPut Option Payoff Patterns 0 000 00 15.3 Some Examples Below we show the most actively traded options on 22 October 2012 ( http:// biz.yahoo.com/opt/stat1.html ). Each option represents a trade on 100 units of the underlying (so that 36,371 Microsoft 29 November calls represent call options on 3.6 million shares of MSFT with an exercise price of $29). The “open interest” is the number of outstanding contracts at the end of the day. For MSFT, 36,371 calls were traded on 22 October, and at the end of the day 206,064 calls were outstanding. 365 Introduction to Options A few facts stand out about this list: • Seven of the options are on indices. The options enable investors/speculators to make bets on broad-based market movements. • The list is approximately evenly divided between puts (8 out of 20) and calls. This is not always true—when investors are optimistic about future market movements, calls tend to dominate the most active, and vice versa. • The options in the most-active list tend to be short-term options. Although longer-term options exist, these are traded less than the near-term. 15.4 Option Payoff and Profit Patterns One of the attractions of options is that they allow their owners to change the payoff patterns of the underlying assets. In this section we consider: • The basic payoff and profit patterns of a call and a put option and a share. • The payoff patterns of various combinations of options and shares.

Suppose you buy a share of General Pills stock in July at its then-current market price of $40. If in September the price of the stock is $70, you will have made a $30 profit; if its price is $30, you will have a loss (or a negative profit) of $10. 3 Generalize this by writing the price of the stock in September as S T and its price in July by S 0 . Then we write the profit function from the stock as: Profit from stock S S T=− 0 Payoff from the Short Sale of a Stock Suppose we had sold one share of GP stock short in July, when its market price was $40. If in September the market price of GP was $70, and if at that point we undid the short sale (i.e., we purchase a share at the market price in order to return the share to the lender of the original short), then our profit would be − $30: Profit from short s ale of stock S S profit from purchase of sto T =− =−0 ( cck) Notice that the profit from the short sale is the negative of the profit from the purchase; this is always the case (also for options, considered below). Graphing Stock Profit Patterns The Excel graph below graphs the profit patterns from both a purchase and a short sale of the GP stock described above. 3. Our use of the word profit in this section constitutes a slight abuse of language and the standard finance concept of the word, since we are ignoring the interest costs associated with buying the asset. In the case at hand, this abuse of language is both traditional and harmless. 367 Introduction to Options Call Option Profit Patterns As in the case of a stock, we start with the payoff pattern from a purchased call . We go back to the General Pills (GP) options of the previous section. Suppose that in July you bought one GP September 40 call for $4. 4 In Sep- tember you will exercise the call only if the market price of GP is higher than $40. If we write the initial (July) call price as C 0 , we can write the profit func- tion from the call in September as follows: Call profit in September S X C S ST T T=− − =− − =−max( , ) max( , )0 40 0 4 40 if ≤ ≤ −>⎧⎨⎩40 44 40 SS TT if -50-40-30-20-1001020304050 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0Proﬁt Terminal stock price, STSTOCK PROFIT PATTERNS Bought stock Shorted stock 4. Because the exercise price of this call is equal to the current market price of the stock, it is called an at-the-money call. When the exercise price of the call is higher than the current market price, it is called an out-of-the-money call, and when the exercise price is lower than the current market price, the call is an in-the-money call. 368 Chapter 15 Payoff Pattern from a Written Call In options markets the purchaser of a call buys the call from a counterparty who issues the call. In the jargon of options, the issuer of the call is called the call writer . It is worthwhile to spend a few minutes considering the difference between the security bought by the call purchaser and the call writer: • The call purchaser buys a security which gives the right to buy a share of stock on or before date T for price X. The cost of this privilege is the call price C 0 , which is paid at the time of the call purchase. Thus the call purchaser has an initial negative cash flow (the purchase price C 0 ); on the other hand, his cash flow at date T is always non-negative: max( S T − X, 0). • The call writer gets C 0 at the date of the call purchase. In return for this price, the writer of the call agrees to sell a share of the stock for price X on or before date T . Notice that whereas the call purchaser has an option, the call writer has undertaken an obligation. Note that the cash flow pattern of the call writer is opposite to that of the call purchaser: The writer ’ s initial cash flow is positive ( + C 0 ), and her cash flow at date T is always non-positive: − max( S T − X, 0). The profit of a call writer is the opposite of that of the call purchaser.

These patterns give an indication of how options can be used to change the payoff patterns of “standard” securities such as stocks and bonds. Here are a few examples. The Protective Put Consider the following combination: • One share of stock, purchased for S 0 • One put, purchased for P with exercise price X 371 Introduction to Options This option strategy is often called a “protective put” strategy or “portfolio insurance”; in Chapter 29 we return to this topic, exploring it in much further detail. The payoff pattern of the protective put is given by: Stock profit P ut profit S S X S P SSX SPTT TT+= − + − − =−+−−00 000 max( , ) ifSSX SSP S X XS P S X SSP S XT TT T TT≤ −− >⎧⎨⎩ =−− ≤ −− >⎧⎨⎩00 00 00if if if When applied to the GP example (that is, buying a share at $40 and a put with X = $40 for $2) this gives the following graph: -40-30-20-10010203040 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0Proﬁt Terminal stock price, STPROTECTIVE PUT PROFIT Stock proﬁ tPutproﬁt ProtecƟve put proﬁ t This pattern looks very much like the payoff pattern from a call. 5 5. In section 15.5 we prove and illustrate the put-call parity theorem . It follows from this theorem that a call must be priced at a price C such that C = P + S 0 − Xe − rT . Thus, when calls are correctly priced according to this theorem, the payoff from a put + stock combination is the same as that from a call + bond combination. We prove this theorem and give an illustration in the next section. 372 Chapter 15 Spreads Another combination involves buying and writing calls with different exercise prices. When the bought call has a low exercise price and the written call has a higher exercise price, the combination is called a bull spread . As an example, suppose you bought a call (for $4) with an exercise price of $40 and wrote a call (for $2) with an exercise price of $50. This bull spread gives a profit of max( , ) (max( , ) ) SS S SSTT T TT−− − −− =−+ ≤ −− + =−40 0 4 50 0 2 42 4 0 40 4 2 42if iifif40 50 40 4 50 2 8 50≤≤ −− − −−= ≥⎧⎨⎪ ⎩⎪S SS S T TT T () The Excel graph given below shows each of the two calls and the resulting spread profit: 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 0Proﬁt Terminal stock price, STBull Spread Pro ﬁt Chart Purchased call, X=40 WriƩen call, X=50 Spreadproﬁt 15.6 Option Arbitrage Propositions In succeeding chapters we price options given specific assumptions about the probability distribution of the underlying asset (usually the stock) on which the option is written. However, there is much that can be learned about the 373 Introduction to Options pricing of options without making these specific probability assumptions. In this section we consider a number of these arbitrage restrictions on option pricing. Our list is by no means exhaustive, and we have concentrated on those propositions which provide insight into the pricing of options or which will be used in later sections. Throughout we assume that there is a single risk-free interest rate which prices bonds; we also assume that this risk-free rate is continuously com-pounded, so that the present value of a riskless security which pays off X at time T is given by e − rT X . proposition 1 Consider a call option written on a stock which pays no divi- dends before the option ’ s expiration date T . Then the lower bound on a call option price is given by: C Max S XerT 00 0 ≥−−(, ) Comment Before proving this proposition, it will be helpful to consider its meaning: Suppose that the riskless interest rate is 10%, and suppose we have an American call option with maturity T = 1/2 (i.e., the expiration date of the option is one-half year from today) with X = 80 written on a stock whose current stock price S 0 = 83. A naive approach to determining a lower bound on this option ’ s price would be to state that it is worth at least $3, since it could be exercised immediately with a profit of $3. Proposition 1 shows that the option ’ s value is at least 83 − e − 0.10*0.5 80 = 6.90. Furthermore, a careful examination of the proof below will show that this fact does not depend on the option being an American option—it is also true for a European option. 1 2 3 456 7 8C B A Current stock price, S 0 83 5 . 0 T , y t i r u t a m o t e m i t n o i t p O 0 8 X , e c i r p e s i c r e x e n o i t p O % 0 1 r , e t a r t s e r e t n I Naive minimum option price, Max(S 0-X,0) 3 <-- =MAX(B2-B4,0) Proposition 1 lower bound on option price, Max(S 0 - Exp(-rT)X,0) 6.902 <-- =MAX(B2-EXP(-B5*B3)*B4,0)PROPOSITION 1—HIGHER LOWER BOUNDS FOR CALL PRICES 374 Chapter 15 Proof of Proposition 1 Standard arbitrage proofs are built on the consider- ation of the cash flows from a particular strategy. In this case the strategy is the following: At time 0 (today): • Buy one share of the stock • Borrow the PV of the option exercise price X • Write a call on the option. At time T: • Exercise the option if this is profitable. • Repay the borrowed funds. This strategy produces the following cash-flow table: Today At Time T Action Cash Flow S T < X S T ≥ X Buy stock − S 0 + S T + S T Borrow PV of X + Xe − rt − X − X Write call + C 0 0 − ( S T − X ) Total − S 0 + Xe − rT + C S T − X < 0 0 Note that at time T , the cash flow resulting from this option is either negative (if the call is not exercised) or zero (when S T ≥ X ). Now a financial asset (in this case: the combination of purchasing a stock, borrowing X , and writing a call) which has only non-positive payoffs in the future must have a positive initial cash flow; this shows that: C S Xe C S XerT rT 00 0 0 0 −+ > >−−−or To finish the proof, we note that in no case can the value of a call be less than zero. Thus we have that C 0 ≥ max( S 0 − Xe − rT , 0), which proves the proposition. Proposition 1 has an immediate and very interesting consequence: In many cases the early-exercise feature of an American call option is worthless; this means that an American call option can be valued as if it were a European call. The precise conditions are the following: 375 Introduction to Options proposition 2 Consider an American call option written on a stock which will not pay any dividends before the option ’ s expiration date T . Then it is never optimal to exercise the option before its maturity. Proof of Proposition 2 Suppose the holder of the option is considering exer- cising it early, at some date t < T . The only reason to consider such early exer- cise is that S t − X > 0, where S t is the price of the underlying stock at time t . However, by Proposition 1 the market value of the option at time t is at least S t − Xe − r(T − t) , where r is the risk-free rate of interest. Since S t − Xe − r(T − t) > S t − X , it follows that the option ’ s holder is better off selling the option in the market than exercising it. Proposition 2 means that many American call options can be priced as if they were European calls. Note that this is not true for American puts, even if the underlying stock pays no dividends; in Chapter 16 we give some examples in the context of a binomial model. proposition 3 ( put bounds ) The lower bound on the value of a put option is: PX e SrT 00 0 ≥−−max( , ) Proof of Proposition 3 The proof of this proposition has the same form as the proof of the previous theorem. We set up a table of strategies: Today At Time T Action Cash Flow S T < X S T ≥ X Short stock + S 0 − S T − S T Lend PV of X − Xe − rT + X + X Write put + P 0 − ( X − S T ) 0 Total P 0 + S 0 − Xe rT 0 X − S T < 0 Since the strategy has only negative or zero payoffs in the future, it must have a positive cash flow today, so that we can conclude that: PX e SrT 00 0 −+ ≥− 376 Chapter 15 Combined with the fact that in no case can a put value be negative, this proves the proposition. proposition 4 ( put - call parity ) Let C 0 be the price of a European call with exercise price X written on a stock whose current price is S 0 . Let P 0 be the price of a European put on the same stock with the same exercise price X . Suppose both put and call have exercise date T , and suppose that the continu- ously compounded interest rate is r . Then: CX e P SrT 00 0 += +− Proof of Proposition 4 The proof is similar in style to that of the two previ- ous propositions. We consider a combination of the four assets (the put, the call, the stock, and a bond), and show that the pricing relation must hold: Today At Time T Action Cash Flow S T < X S T ≥ X Buy call − C 0 0 + S T − X Buy a bond with payoff X at time T − Xe − rT X X Write a put + P 0 − ( X − S T )0 Short one share of the stock + S 0 − S T − S T Total − C 0 − Xe − rT + P 0 + S 0 00 Since the strategy has future payoffs which are zero no matter what happens to the price of the stock, it follows that the initial cash flow of the strategy must also be zero. 6 This means that: CX e P SrT 00 0 0 +− − =− which proves the proposition. 6. This is a fundamental fact of finance: If a financial strategy has future payoffs which are identi- cally zero, then its current cost must also be zero. Likewise, if a financial strategy has future payoffs which are non-negative, then its time-zero payoff must be negative (that is, it must cost something). 377 Introduction to Options Put-call parity states that the stock price S 0 , the price of a call C 0 with exer- cise price X and the price of a put P 0 with exercise price X , are simultaneously determined with the interest rate r . Following is an illustration which uses the call price C 0 , the option exercise price X , the current stock price S 0 , and the interest rate r to compute the price of a put with exercise price X and time to maturity T : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9C B A Current stock price, S 0 55 Option time to maturity, T 0.5 Option exercise price, X 60 % 0 1 r , e t a r t s e r e t n I Call price, C 0 3 Put price, P 0 5.0738 <-- =B6+B4*EXP(-B5*B3)-B2PUT-CALL PARITY This spreadsheet uses put-call parity to derive the put price P 0 from the call price C0, the interest rate r, the time to maturity T, and the exercise price X. proposition 5 ( call option price convexity ) Consider three European calls, all written on the same non-dividend paying stock and with the same expiration date T . We suppose that the exercise prices on the calls are X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 , and denote the associated call prices by C 1 , C 2 , and C 3 . We further assume that XXX 213 2=+ . Then CCC 213 2<+ It follows that the call option price is a convex function of the exercise price. 378 Chapter 15 Proof of Proposition 6 To prove the proposition, we consider the following strategy of three calls with exercise prices X 1 < X 2 < X 3 . We suppose one call each with exercise price X 1 and X 3 is purchased and that two calls with exercise price X 2 are written. Such a strategy is commonly called a “butterfly.” 7 At Time 0 At Time T Action Cash Flow S T < X 1 X 1 ≤ S T < X 2 X 2 ≤ S T < X 3 X 3 ≤ S T Buy call with exercise price X 1 − C 1 0 S T − X 1 S T − X 1 S T − X 1 Buy call with exercise price X 3 − C 3 00 0 S T − X 3 Write two calls with exercise price X 2 + 2 C 2 00 − 2 ( S T − X 2 ) − 2 ( S T − X 2 ) Total 2 C 2 − C 1 − C 3 0 S T − X 1 ≥ 0 2X 2 − X 1 − S T = X 3 − S T > 0 0 Since the payoffs in the future are all non-negative (with a positive probabil- ity of being positive, it follows that the initial cash flow from the position must be negative: 202213 213CCC CCC−−< ⇒ <+ This proves the proposition. (Note that the assumption that XXX 213 2=+ i s made for convenience and does not affect the generality of the argument.) Without proof we state a similar proposition for puts: proposition 6 ( put price convexity ) Consider three European puts, all written on the same non-dividend paying stock and with the same expiration date T . We suppose that the exercise prices on the calls are X 1 , X 2 , and X 3 , and denote the associated put prices by P 1 , P 2 , and P 3 . We further assume that XXX 213 2=+ . Then the put price is a convex function of the exercise price: 7. Any strategy of three options (calls or puts) with three exercise prices in which one option each of the extreme exercise price is either bought or written and in which two options with the middle exercise price are held in the opposite position is called a butterfly. 379 Introduction to Options PPP 213 2<+ Without proof we state a similar proposition for a butterfly composed of puts. proposition 7 ( call option bounds with a known future dividend ) Consider a call with exercise price X and maturity date T . Suppose that at some time t < T , the stock will, with certainty, pay a dividend D . Then the lower bound on the call option price is given by: CS D e X ert rT 00 0 ≥− −−−max( , ) Proof of Proposition 7 The proof involves only a minor modification of the proof of Proposition 1. Today Time t At Time T Action Cash Flow S T < X S T ≥ X Buy stock − S 0 + D + S T + S T Borrow the PV of the dividend D + De − rT − D Borrow PV of X + Xe − rT − X − X Write call + C 0 0 − ( S T − X ) Total − S 0 + De − rt + Xe − rT + C 0 0 S T − X < 0 0 This proves the proposition. 15.7 Summary This chapter summarizes the basic definitions and features of options. It is, however, by no means an adequate introduction to these complex securities for those with no preknowledge. To decipher the mysteries of options, we recommend the introductory chapters of a good option text. 380 Chapter 15 Exercises 1. When you looked at the newspaper quotes for options on ABC stock, you saw that a February call option with X = 37.5 is priced at 6.375, whereas the April call option with the same exercise price is priced at 6. Can you devise an arbitrage out of these prices? Do you have an explanation for the newspaper quotes? 2. An American call option is written on a stock whose price today is S = 50. The exercise price of the call is X = 45. a. If the call price is 2, explain how you would use arbitrage to make an immediate profit. b. If the option is exercisable at time T = 1 year and if the interest rate is 10%, what is the minimum price of the option? Use Proposition 1. 3. A European call option is written on a stock whose current price S = 80. The exercise price X = 80, the interest rate r = 8%, and the time to option exercise T = 1. The stock is assumed to pay a dividend of 3 at time t = ½. Use Proposition 7 to determine the minimum price of the call option. 4. A put with an exercise price of 50 has a price of 6 and a call on the same stock with an exercise price of 60 has a price of 10. Both put and call have the same expiration date. On the same set of axes, draw the profit diagram for: a. One put bought and one call bought. b. Two puts bought and one call bought. c. Three puts bought and one call bought. d. All three lines cross each other for the same value of S T . Derive this value. 5. Consider the following two calls: • Both calls are written on shares of ABC Corp. whose current share price is $100. ABC does not pay any dividends. • Both calls have one year to maturity. • One call has X 1 = 90 and has price of 30; the second call has X 2 = 100 and has price of 20. • The riskless, continuously compounded interest rate is 10%. By designing a spread (i.e., buying one call and writing another) position, show that the difference between the two call prices is too large and that a riskless arbitrage exists. 6. A share of ABC Corp. sells for $95. A call on the share with exercise price $90 sells for $8. a. Graph the profit pattern from buying one share and one call on the share. b. Graph the profit pattern from buying one share and two calls. c. Consider the profit pattern from buying one share and calls. At which share price do all of the profit lines cross? 7. A European call with a maturity of 6 months and exercise price X = 80 is written on a stock whose current price is 85 is selling for $12.00; a European put written on the same stock with the same maturity and with the same exercise price is selling for $5.00. If the annual interest rate (continuously compounded) is 10%, construct an arbitrage from this situation. 381 Introduction to Options 8. Prove Proposition 6. Then solve the following problem: Three puts on shares of XYZ with the same expiration date are selling at the following prices: Exercise price 40: 6 Exercise price 50: 4 Exercise price 60: 1 Show an arbitrage strategy which allows you to profit from these prices and prove that it works. 9. The current stock price of ABC Corp. is 50. Prices for six-month calls on ABC are given in the table below. Draw a profit diagram of the following strategy: Buy one 40 call, write two 50 calls, buy one 60 call, and write two 70 calls. Call Price 40 16.5 50 9.560 4.570 2 10. Consider the following option strategy, which consists only of calls: Exercise Price Bought/Written?

The prices given include one violation of an arbitrage condition. Identify this violation and explain. 11. A share of Formila Corp. is currently trading at $38.50, and a 1-year call option on Formila with X = $40 is trading at $3. The risk-free interest rate is 4.5%. a. What should be the price of a 1-year put option on the stock with X = $40? Why? b. If the price of a put is $2, construct an arbitrage strategy. c. If the price of a put is $4, construct an arbitrage strategy. 1 6 The Binomial Option Pricing Model 16.1 Overview Next to the Black-Scholes model (discussed in Chapter 17), the binomial option pricing model is the most widely used option pricing model. It has many advantages: It is a simple model, which—in addition to giving many insights into option pricing—is easily programmed and adapted to numerous, and often quite complicated, option pricing problems. When extended to many periods, the binomial model becomes one of the most powerful ways of valuing securities like options whose payoffs are contingent on the market prices of other assets. The binomial model depends on using state prices to compute the values of risky assets. When the state pricing principles underlying the model are under-stood, we gain deeper insight into the economics of contingent asset pricing. In this chapter, which illustrates the simple uses of the binomial model, we devote a considerable amount of space to deriving and using state prices. In Chapters 29 and 30 we return to the binomial model and use it in the Monte Carlo pricing of contingent securities. 16.2 Two-Date Binomial Pricing To illustrate the use of the binomial model, we start with the following very simple example: • There is one period and two dates, date 0 = today and date 1 = one year from now. • There are two “fundamental” assets: A stock and a bond. There is also a derivative asset, a call option written on the stock. • The stock price today is $50 and at date 1 will either go up by 10% or go down by 3%. • The one-period interest rate is 6%. • The call option matures at date 1 and has exercise price X = $50. Here is a picture from a spreadsheet which incorporates this model. Notice that in cells B2, B3, and B6 we have used values for 1 plus the 10% up move, 1 plus the − 3% down move, and 1 plus the 6% interest. We use capital letters U , D , and R to denote these values. 1 1. Should there be a need to distinguish between 1.10—1 plus the 10% up move of the stock—and 10% (the up move itself), we will use U for the former and lowercase u for the latter. 384 Chapter 16 We wish to price the call option. We do this by showing that there is a combination of the bonds and stocks which exactly replicates the call option ’ s payoffs . To show this, we use some basic linear algebra; suppose we find A shares of the stock and B bonds such that: 55 1 06 5 48 5 1 06 0AB AB+= +=. .. This system of equations solves to give A BA=−= =−=−5 55 48 50 7692 04 8 5 10 635 1959.. . .. Thus purchasing 0.77 of a share of the stock and borrowing $35.20 at 6% for one period will give payoffs of $5 if the stock price goes up and $0 if the stock price goes down—the payoffs of the call option. It follows that the price of the option must be equal to the cost of replicating its payoffs; that is, Call option price =∗ − −0 7692 50 35 1959 3 2656.$ $ . $ . This logic is called “pricing by arbitrage”: If two assets or sets of assets (in our case—the call option and the portfolio of 0.77 of the stock and − $35.20 of the bonds) have the same payoffs, they must have the same market price. 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17AB C D EF G H I J Up, U 1.10 Down, D 0.97 Initial stock price 50.00 Interest rate, R 1.06Exercise price 50.00 e c i r p d n o B e c i r p k c o t S 6 $ B $ * 1 1 $ G $ = - - < 6 0 . 1 2 B * 1 1 $ B $ = - - < 0 0 . 5 5 0 0 . 1 0 0 . 0 5 6 $ B $ * 1 1 $ G $ = - - < 6 0 . 1 3 B * 1 1 $ B $ = - - < 0 5 . 8 4 Call option 5.00 <-- =MAX(D10-$B$7,0) ??? 0.00 <-- =MAX(D12-$B$7,0)BINOMIAL OPTION PRICING IN A ONE-PERIOD MODEL 385 The Binomial Option Pricing Model Applying the same logic to a put gives the put price as 0.4354: 19 2021 22 23AB C D EF G Solving the portfolio problem: A shares + B bonds combine to give option payoffs A 0.7692 <-- =D15/(D10-D12) B -35.1959 <-- =-D12*B20/B6 Call price 3.2656 <-- =B20*B5+B21 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 1415 16 17AB C D E F G G Up, U 1.10 Down, D 0.97 Solving the put price 55*A+1.06*B=0 5 . 1 = B * 6 0 . 1 + A * 5 . 8 4 0 0 . 0 5 e c i r p k c o t s l a i t i n I Interest rate, R 1.06 ) 5 . 8 4 - 5 5 ( / 5 . 1 - = A 0 0 . 0 5 e c i r p e s i c r e x E Put option B=-55*A/1.06 0.00 <-- =MAX($B$7-B5*B2,0) ??? 1.50 <-- =MAX($B$7-B5*B3,0) Solving the portfolio problem: A shares + B bonds combine to give option payoffs A -0.2308 <-- =-D11/(B5*(B2-B3)) B 11.9739 <-- =-B5*B2*B14/B6 Put price 0.4354 <-- =B14*B5+B15BINOMIAL PUT OPTION PRICING IN A ONE-PERIOD MODEL In succeeding sections we show that this simple arbitrage argument can be extended to multiple periods. But in the meantime we confine ourselves in the next section to generalizing the logic. 16.3 State Prices There is actually a simpler (and more general) way to solve this problem: Viewed from today, there are only two possibilities for next period: Either the stock price goes up or it goes down. Think about the market determining a price q U for $1 in the “up” state of the world and a price q D for $1 in the “down” state of the world. Then both the bond and the stock have to be priced using these state prices : 386 Chapter 16 q S Uq S DS q Uq D qR qRUD U D UD∗∗ + ∗∗ = ⇒ + = ∗+ ∗=1 1 The state prices are thus an illustration of the linear pricing principle: If the stock price can move up in one period by a factor U and down by a factor D , and if 1 plus the one-period interest rate is R , then any other asset will be priced by discounting its payoff in the “up” state by q U and by discounting its payoff in the “down” state by q D . The two equations above solve to give: qRD RU DqUR RU DUD=− −=− − (),() In our case these state prices are given by: 1 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 10 11 12C B A 0 1 . 1 U , p U 7 9 . 0 D , n w o D 6 0 . 1 R , e t a r t s e r e t n I State prices qU 0.6531 <-- =(B4-B3)/(B4*(B2-B3)) qD 0.2903 <-- =(B2-B4)/(B4*(B2-B3)) Pricing the stock: 1 = q U*U+q D*D? 1 <-- =B7*B2+B8*B3 Pricing the bond: 1/R = q U+qD ? 1.06 <-- =1/(B7+B8)Check: Confirm that state prices actually price the stock and the bondDERIVING THE STATE PRICES In rows 11 and 12 we check that the state prices indeed give back the interest rate and the stock price.

Because the framework here is discrete time, PV(X) is also discrete-time: PV(X)=X/(1+r)=X/R.

Multiplying the state prices by 1 plus the interest rate, R , gives the risk-neutral prices : π U = q U R , π D = q D R . The risk-neutral prices look like a probability distribution of the states, since they sum to 1: ππUD U D qR qRRD RU DRUR RU DR += + =− −+− −=() ()1 Furthermore, there is a fundamental equivalence of pricing by the risk-neutral prices and pricing by the state prices. Suppose an asset has state-dependent payoffs X U in the “up” state and X D in the “down” state of a 2-date model. Then the date 0 price of the asset using the state prices is q U X U + q D X D and the date 0 price of the asset using the risk-neutral prices is the discounted expected asset payoff, where the expectation is computed using the risk-neutral prices as if they are the actual state probabilities: ππUU DDXX RExpected asset payoff using risk neutral prices r+=+“” - 1 ==+qX qXUU DD Pricing with state prices or pricing with risk-neutral prices is, of course, the same. This author prefers to use state prices, but many researchers are more comfortable using the pseudo-probabilities of the risk-neutral prices and then discounting the “expected” payoffs.

Consider, for example, a two-period (three-date) binomial model that has the following characteristics: • In each period the stock price goes up by 10% or down by − 3% from what it was in the previous period. This means that U = 1.10, D = 0.97. • In each period the interest rate is 6%, so that R = 1.06. Because U , D , and R are the same in each period, qRD RU DqUR RU DUD=− −==− −=().,(). 0 6531 0 2903 390 Chapter 16 We can now use these state prices to price a call option written on the stock after two periods. As before, we assume that the stock price is $50 initially and that the call exercise price is X = 50 after two periods. This gives the fol- lowing picture: e c i r p d n o B e c i r p k c o t S 6 3 2 1 . 1 0 0 0 5 . 0 6 0 0 6 0 . 1 0 0 0 0 . 5 5 6 3 2 1 . 1 0 0 . 1 0 0 5 3 . 3 5 0 0 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 6 0 . 1 0 0 0 5 . 8 4 6 3 2 1 . 1 0 5 4 0 . 7 4 Date 0 Date 1 Date 2 Call option price 10.5000 7.8302 0 0 5 3 . 3 2 9 4 7 . 5 2.1880 0.0000 How was the call option price of 5.7492 determined? To do this, we go back-ward, starting at period two: At date two : At the end of two periods the stock price is either $60.50 (cor- responding to two “up” movements in the price), $53.35 (one “up” and one “down” movement), or $47.05 (two “down” movements in the price). Given the exercise price of X = 50, this means that the terminal option payoff in period 2 is $10.50, $3.35, or $0. At date one : At date one, there are two possibilities: Either we have reached an “up” state, in which case the current stock price is $55 and the option will pay off $10.50 or $3.35 in the next period: 10.5000 ???? 3.3500 We use the state prices of q u = 0.6531, q d = 0.2903 to price the option at this state: Option price at up state date “” , . . . . . 1 0 6531 10 50 0 2903 3 35 7 83=∗ +∗ = 0 02 The alternative possibility is that we ’ re in the “down” state of period one: 391 The Binomial Option Pricing Model 3.3500 ???? 0.0000 Using the same state prices (which, after all, depend only on the “up” and “down” movements of the stock price and the interest rate), we get: Option price at down state date 1 “” , . .. . =∗ +∗ =0 6531 3 35 0 2903 0 2 1880 At date 0 : Going backward in this way, we ’ ve now filled in the following picture: 10.5000 7.8302 0 0 5 3 . 3 ? ? ? ? 2.1880 0.0000 Thus at period 0 the buyer of an option owns a security which will be worth $7.83 if the underlying stock has an “up” movement in its return and which will be worth $2.19 if the stock has a “down” movement in its return.

The answer is “no.” There ’ s no necessity to price the call price payoffs “backward” at each node back from the terminal date, as long as the call is European . 2 It is enough to price each of the terminal payoffs by the state prices, providing you count properly the number of paths to each terminal node. Here ’ s an illustration, using the same example: 2. When we discuss American options in section 16.5 we will see that backward pricing is critical. 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 111213 14 15161718 19 20AB C D E F G H 0 1 . 1 U , p U 7 9 . 0 D , n w o D State prices 6 0 . 1 R , e t a r t s e r e t n I qU 0.6531 <-- =(B4-B3)/(B4*(B2-B3)) Initial stock price, S 50.00 qD 0.2903 <-- =(B2-B4)/(B4*(B2-B3)) Option exercise price, X 50.00 Number of \"up\" steps at terminal dateNumber of \"down\" steps at terminal dateTerminal stock price = S*U^(# up) *D^(# down)Option payoff at terminal stateState price for terminal date = q U^(# up) *qD^(# down)Number of paths to terminal stateValue =payoff*state price*#paths 4 0 73.2050 23.2050 0.1820 1 4.2224 3 1 64.5535 14.5535 0.0809 4 4.7078 2 2 56.9245 6.9245 0.0359 6 1.4933 1 3 50.1970 0.1970 0.0160 4 0.0126 0 4 44.2646 0.0000 0.0071 1 0.0000 Call price 10.4360 <-- =SUM(G10:G14) Put price 0.0407 <-- =G15+B6/B4^4-B5 NotesThere are 5 dates in this model (0, 1, ... , 5) but only 4 periods and thus only 4 possible \"up\" or \"down\" steps.The put price in cell G16 is computed using put-call parity: put = call + PV(X) - stock BINOMIAL OPTION PRICING WITH STATE PRICES IN A FOUR-PERIOD (FIVE-DATE) MODEL Here is an explanation for the table above: For each terminal option payoff, we consider: 394 Chapter 16 How was this terminal payoff reached?

We reconsider the basic model above, in which U p = 1.10, Down = 0.97, R = 1.06, S = 50, X = 50. We examine the three-date version of the model. Recall from Chapter 15 that an American call option on a non-dividend-paying stock has the same value as a European call option. It is thus more interesting to start with the pricing of an American put. The payoff patterns for the stock and the bond have been given above, and it remains only to consider the payoff patterns for a put option with X = 50. We reference the states of the world by using the following labels: UU U UD orDU D DDState labels 0 Put Payoffs at Date Three Here are the values of the stock and the date three put payoffs: Stock price American put payoffs 0 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 0 5 . 0 6 ? ? ? ? 0 0 0 0 . 5 5 0 0 0 0 . 0 ? ? ? ? 0 0 5 3 . 3 5 0 0 0 0 . 0 5 ? ? ? ? 0 0 0 5 . 8 4 0 5 5 9 . 2 0 5 4 0 . 7 4 396 Chapter 16 At date two, the holder of an American put can choose whether to hold the put or to exercise it. We now have the following value function: Put value at date 2 state UPut value if exercised X S qU U==− ()maxmax , 0 ∗∗+ ∗⎧⎨⎩ Put payoff in state UU q Put payoff in state UD D A similar function holds for the put value in state d at date two. The resulting tree now looks like: American put payoffs 0.0000 0.0000 0 0 0 0 . 0 ? ? ? ? 1.5000 2.9550 Here ’ s the explanation: • In state U , the put is valueless. When the stock price is $55, it is not worth- while to early-exercise the put, since max( X − S U , 0) = max(50 − 55, 0) = 0.

In the binomial model the price can move up or down in any time period. If q U is the state price associated with an up move and if q D is the state price associated with a down move, then the binomial European option prices are given by: Binomial Europe an calln iqq S U D XUi Dni i ni in =⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ ∗− −− =max( , ) 0 0∑ ∑ =⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ −∗ −− = Binomial European putn iqq X S U DUi Dni i ni imax( , ) 0 0n n or by put call parity∑⎧ ⎨⎪ ⎩⎪- 399 The Binomial Option Pricing Model where U is an up move, R is a down move in the stock price, and n i⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ is the binomial coefficient (the number of up moves in n total moves: n in ini⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟=− ()! !! We use Excel ’ s Combin(n,i) to give values for the binomial coefficients. Here are two VBA functions which compute the value of binomial European calls and puts. The function Binomial_eur_put uses put-call parity to price the put: Function Binomial_eur_call(Up, Down, Interest, _ Stock, Exercise, Periods) q_up = (Interest - Down) / _ (Interest * (Up - Down)) q_down = 1 / Interest - q_up Binomial_eur_call = 0 For Index = 0 To Periods Binomial_eur_call = Binomial_eur_call _ + Application.Combin(Periods, Index) _ * q_up ∧ Index * q_down ∧ (Periods - Index) _ * Application.Max(Stock * Up ∧ Index * Down _ ∧ (Periods - Index) - Exercise, 0) Next Index End Function Function Binomial_eur_put(Up, Down, Interest, _ Stock, Exercise, Periods) Binomial_eur_put = Binomial_eur_call _ (Up, Down, Interest, Stock, Exercise, _ Periods) + Exercise / Interest ∧ Periods - Stock End Function 400 Chapter 16 Implementing this in a spreadsheet, we get for the four-period example of section 16.4: 1 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 13 14C B A 0 1 . 1 U , p U 7 9 . 0 D , n w o D 6 0 . 1 R , e t a r t s e r e t n I 0 0 . 0 5 S , e c i r p k c o t s l a i t i n I Option exercise price, X 50.00 4 n , s d o i r e p f o r e b m u N ) 7 B , 6 B , 5 B , 4 B , 3 B , 2 B ( l l a c _ r u e _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 0 6 3 4 . 0 1 l l a c n a e p o r u E ) 7 B , 6 B , 5 B , 4 B , 3 B , 2 B ( t u p _ r u e _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 7 0 4 0 . 0 t u p n a e p o r u E 0 1 B + 5 B = - - < 7 0 4 0 . 0 5 t u p + k c o t S 7 B ^ 4 B / 6 B + 9 B = - - < 7 0 4 0 . 0 5 ) X ( V P + l l a CVBA FUNCTIONS FOR CALLS AND PUTS Checking put-call parity American Put Pricing Proposition 2 in section 15.6 states that the price of an American call on a non-dividend-paying stock is the same as that of a European option. The pricing of an American put, however, can be different. The following VBA function below uses a binomial option pricing model like the one from section 16.5 to price American puts: 401 The Binomial Option Pricing Model Function Binomial_amer_put(Up, Down, Interest, _ Stock, Exercise, Periods) q_up = (Interest - Down) / (Interest * _ (Up - Down)) q_down = 1 / Interest - q_up Dim OptionReturnEnd() As Double Dim OptionReturnMiddle() As Double ReDim OptionReturnEnd(Periods + 1) For State = 0 To Periods OptionReturnEnd(State) = Application.Max(Exercise _ - Stock * Up ∧ State * Down ∧ (Periods - State), 0) Next State For Index = Periods - 1 To 0 Step -1 ReDim OptionReturnMiddle(Index) For State = 0 To Index OptionReturnMiddle(State) = Application.Max _ (Exercise - Stock * Up ∧ State * Down ∧ _ (Index - State), _ q_down * OptionReturnEnd(State) + q_up * _ OptionReturnEnd(State + 1)) Next State ReDim OptionReturnEnd(Index) For State = 0 To Index OptionReturnEnd(State) = _ OptionReturnMiddle(State) Next State Next Index Binomial_amer_put = OptionReturnMiddle(0) End Function 402 Chapter 16 In this function we use two arrays, called OptionReturnEnd and OptionReturnMiddle . At each date t , these arrays store the option values for the date itself and the next date— t + 1. Here ’ s an implementation in a spreadsheet, using the two-period, three-date, example from section 16.5: 1 2 3456 7 89 10 11 12C B A 0 1 . 1 U , p U 7 9 . 0 D , n w o D 6 0 . 1 R , e t a r t s e r e t n I 0 0 . 0 5 S , e c i r p k c o t s l a i t i n I Option exercise price, X 50.00 2 n , s d o i r e p f o r e b m u N ) 7 B , 6 B , 5 B , 4 B , 3 B , 2 B ( t u p _ r e m a _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 4 5 3 4 . 0 t u p n a c i r e m A ) 7 B , 6 B , 5 B , 4 B , 3 B , 2 B ( t u p _ r u e _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 0 9 4 2 . 0 t u p n a e p o r u E ) 7 B , 6 B , 5 B , 4 B , 3 B , 2 B ( l l a c _ r e m a _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 2 9 4 7 . 5 l l a c n a c i r e m A ) 7 B , 6 B , 5 B , 4 B , 3 B , 2 B ( l l a c _ r u e _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 2 9 4 7 . 5 l l a c n a e p o r u EVBA FUNCTIONS FOR CALLS AND PUTS The values in cells B9 and B10 are for an American and a European put; these values correspond to those given in section 16.5. In cell B11 we use a function similar to the American put function to price American calls. Unsur-prisingly—given Proposition 2 of Chapter 15—this function gives the same value as the binomial European call pricing function. The VBA function works well for many more periods. 3 In the example below we calculate the value of an American put and call for options which expire at T = 0.75 of a year. The stochastic process which defines the stock returns has mean μ = 15%, and standard deviation σ = 35%. The annual continuously compounded interest rate is r = 6%, and each year is divided into 25 subperiods, so that a single period has length Δ t = 1/25 = 0.04. Given these numbers, Up, Down, and R are defined by Up Down R ett tt r t== =+−eeμσ μσ ΔΔ ΔΔ Δ,, . Here is the pricing of an American and a European call and put: 3. The discussion which follows is perhaps best read after Chapters 17 and 26. 403 The Binomial Option Pricing Model Notice that we have compromised on the number of periods, by using Excel ’ s Round function—since there are 25 divisions of one year and the option ’ s maturity is T = 0.75, the actual number of periods to maturity is 25*0.75, which is not a round number. This procedure works well even for a very large number of periods. In the example below, the option has a maturity T = 0.5, and the basic one-year period is divided into 400 subperiods. Excel easily computes the value of the American put and call, even though a considerable amount of computation is involved: 1 23 4 56 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 1819 20C B A Mean return per year, μ 15% Standard deviation of annual return, σ 35% % 6 r , e t a r t s e r e t n i l a u n n A 0 0 . 0 5 S , e c i r p k c o t s l a i t i n I Option exercise price, X 50.00 Option exercise date (years) 0.75 Number of divisions of 1 year 25 <-- each year divided into 25 subperiods Δt, the length of one division 0.04 <-- =1/B9 Up move per Δt 1.078963 <-- =EXP(B2*B10+B3*SQRT(B10)) Down move per Δt 0.938005 <-- =EXP(B2*B10-B3*SQRT(B10)) Interest rate per Δ t 1.002403 <-- =EXP(B4*B10) Number of periods until maturity, n 19 <-- =ROUND(B8*B9,0) ) 5 1 B , 7 B , 6 B , 3 1 B , 2 1 B , 1 1 B ( t u p _ r e m a _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 1 1 3 1 . 5 t u p n a c i r e m A ) 5 1 B , 7 B , 6 B , 3 1 B , 2 1 B , 1 1 B ( t u p _ r u e _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 3 1 2 9 . 4 t u p n a e p o r u E ) 5 1 B , 7 B , 6 B , 3 1 B , 2 1 B , 1 1 B ( l l a c _ r e m a _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 1 0 5 1 . 7 l l a c n a c i r e m A ) 5 1 B , 7 B , 6 B , 3 1 B , 2 1 B , 1 1 B ( l l a c _ r u e _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 1 0 5 1 . 7 l l a c n a e p o r u EVBA FUNCTIONS FOR CALLS AND PUTS n divisions per year, Dt = 1/n Up=exp( m*Dt + s*sqrt( Dt)), Down = exp( m*Dt - s*sqrt( Dt)) 404 Chapter 16 16.7 Convergence of Binomial Pricing to the Black-Scholes Price In this section we discuss the convergence of the binomial model to the Black- Scholes pricing formula. The discussion assumes some understanding of log-normality (discussed in Chapter 26) and the Black-Scholes option pricing formula discussed in Chapter 17. So you may want to skip this section and come back to it later. Whenever we consider a finite approximation to the option pricing formulas, we have to use an approximation to the up and the down movements. One widespread translation of the interest rate r and the stock ’ s volatility σ to an “up” or “down” move necessary for the binomial model is: ΔΔ ΔΔtT n Re U up e D down ert tt== =+ = =+ =−/ 11σσ 1 23 4 56 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15 16 17 1819 20C B A Mean return per year, μ 15% Standard deviation of annual return, σ 35% % 6 r , e t a r t s e r e t n i l a u n n A 0 0 . 0 5 S , e c i r p k c o t s l a i t i n I Option exercise price, X 50.00 Option exercise date (years) 0.50 Number of divisions of 1 year 400 <-- each year divided into 400 subperiods Δt, the length of one division 0.0025 <-- =1/B9 Up move per Δt 1.018036 <-- =EXP(B2*B10+B3*SQRT(B10)) Down move per Δt 0.983021 <-- =EXP(B2*B10-B3*SQRT(B10)) Interest rate per Δ t 1.00015 <-- =EXP(B4*B10) Number of periods until maturity, n 200 <-- =ROUND(B8*B9,0) ) 5 1 B , 7 B , 6 B , 3 1 B , 2 1 B , 1 1 B ( t u p _ r e m a _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 2 8 8 2 . 4 t u p n a c i r e m A ) 5 1 B , 7 B , 6 B , 3 1 B , 2 1 B , 1 1 B ( t u p _ r u e _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 1 7 4 1 . 4 t u p n a e p o r u E ) 5 1 B , 7 B , 6 B , 3 1 B , 2 1 B , 1 1 B ( l l a c _ r e m a _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 8 4 2 6 . 5 l l a c n a c i r e m A ) 5 1 B , 7 B , 6 B , 3 1 B , 2 1 B , 1 1 B ( l l a c _ r u e _ l a i m o n i b = - - < 8 4 2 6 . 5 l l a c n a e p o r u EVBA FUNCTIONS FOR CALLS AND PUTS n divisions per year, Δt = 1/n Up=exp( μ*Δt + σ*sqrt( Δt)), Down = exp( * Δt - σ μ*sqrt( Δt)) 405 The Binomial Option Pricing Model This approximation guarantees that as Δ t → 0 (i.e., as n → ∞ ), the resulting distribution of the stock returns approaches the lognormal distribution. 4 Here ’ s an implementation of this methodology in a spreadsheet.

As the n gets larger, this approximation gets better, though the convergence to the Black-Scholes price is not smooth: 4. An alternative approximation which converges to a lognormal price process is given in the next subsection. See also Omberg (1987), Hull (2006), and Benninga, Steinmetz, and Stroughair (1993). 406 Chapter 16 An Alternative Approximation to the Lognormal The approximation of the first part of this section is not the only approximation which works.

Like all call options, the value of an ESO depends on the current price of the stock, the option ’ s exercise price, and the time until exercise. However, ESOs typically have several special conditions: • The option has a vesting period. During this period, the employee is not allowed to exercise the option. An employee leaving the company before the vesting period forfeits his option. In the model of this section we assume that a typical employee of the company leaves at exit rate e per year. • An employee leaving the company after the vesting period is forced to immediately exercise his option. • For tax reasons, almost all ESOs have exercise prices equal to the stock price on the date of issue. In the model below, adapted from a paper by Hull and White (2004), we assume that an employee will choose to exercise her option when the price of the stock is greater than some multiple m of the ESO ’ s exercise price X. We first present the model ’ s implementation and results and then discuss the VBA program, which gives us these results: 1 23456789 1011121314C B A e c i r p k c o t s t n e r r u C 0 5 S e c i r p e s i c r e x e n o i t p O 0 5 X ) s r a e y n i ( e s i c r e x e n o i t p o o t e m i T 0 0 . 0 1 TVesting period (years) 3.00 e t a r t s e r e t n i l a u n n A % 0 0 . 5 t s e r e t n I k c o t s f o s s e n i k s i R % 5 3 a m g i S Stock dividend rate 2.50% Annual dividend rate on stock % 0 0 . 0 1 e , e t a r t i x E Option exercise multiple, m 3.00 r a e y e n o f o s n o i s i v i d b u s f o r e b m u N 0 5 n Employee stock option value 13.56 <-- =ESO(B2,B3,B4,B5,B6,B7,B8,B9,B10,B11) Black-Scholes call 19.18 <-- =BSCall(B2*EXP(-B8*B4),B3,B4,B6,B7)A BINOMIAL EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PRICING MODEL Based on Hull-White (2004) 6. This section has benefited from discussions with Torben V oetmann of Brattle Group and Zvi Wiener of Hebrew University, Jerusalem. 409 The Binomial Option Pricing Model The ESO function in cell B13 depends on the 10 variables listed in cells B2:B11. The screen for this function looks like: In the example above, the employee stock option is given when the stock price is $50. The ESO has exercise price X = $50. The option has a 10-year maturity and a 3-year vesting period. The interest rate is 5% annually, and the stock pays an annual dividend of 2.5% of its stock value. The rate at which employees leave the company is 10% per year. The model assumes that after the vesting period, the employee will choose to exercise his option if the stock price is three times or more the option ’ s exercise price. 7 The binomial model with which the computations in cell B13 were done divides each year into 50 subdivisions. Given these assumptions, the employee stock option is valued at $13.56 (cell B13). A comparable Black-Scholes option on a dividend-paying stock would be valued at $19.18. 8 The ESO Valuation and FASB 123 The American Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the Inter-national Accounting Standards Board (IASB) agree that executive stock options should be priced using a model of the type explored above, and that the value of options awarded should be accounted for in a firm ’ s net income. If, for example, a firm had issued 1 million options of the type which appear in the previous spreadsheet, we would value these options at $13,564,600. 7. Research cited by Hull and White (2004) shows that the average stock-price-to-exercise-price ratio at which ESO owners exercise their options is between 2.2 and 2.8. 8. We ’ re getting way ahead of ourselves here! The adaptation of Black-Scholes for dividend- paying stock is given in section 17.6. 410 Chapter 16 The VBA Code for the ESO Model Below we give the VBA code for this model. A short discussion follows the code.

The first part defines the variables, adjusting the Up, Down, and 1 plus interest R for the n divisions of each year. Having made this adjustment, the code defines the risk-neutral probabilities π Up and π Down : 9. This subsection is tedious and can be skipped. But take a look at the next subsection, where we use Data|Table to do sensitivity analysis. Up = Exp(Sigma * Sqr(1 / n)) Down = Exp(-Sigma * Sqr(1 / n)) R = Exp(Interest / n) Div = Exp(-Divrate / n) ‘Risk-neutral Up and Down probabilities piUp = (R * Div - Down) / (Up - Down) piDown = (Up - R * Div) / (Up - Down) The stock price is defined as an array S ( i , j ), where i defines the periods, i = 0, 1, … , T * n , and j defines the number of Up steps at each period, j = 0, 1, … , i . The next part of the code defines the stock price. 413 The Binomial Option Pricing Model The option values are defined in the next piece of code, which is the heart of our employee stock option function. Option value is defined as an array Opt( i , j ): ‘Option value on the last nodes of tree For i = 0 To T * n Opt(T * n, i) = _ Application.Max(S(T * n, i) - X, 0) Next i ‘Early exercise when stock price > multiple ‘ * exercise after vesting For i = T * n - 1 To 0 Step -1 For j = 0 To i If i > Vest * n And S(i, j) > = Multiple * X _ Then Opt(i, j) = Application.Max(S(i, j) - X, 0) If i > Vest * n And S(i, j) < Multiple * X _ Then Opt(i, j) = ((1 - Exitrate / n) * _ (piUp * Opt(i + 1, j + 1) + piDown * _ Opt(i + 1, j)) / R + Exitrate / n * _ Application.Max(S(i, j) - X, 0)) If i < = Vest * n Then Opt(i, j) = _ (1 - Exitrate / n) * (piUp * _ Opt(i + 1, j + 1) + piDown * Opt(i + 1, j)) / R Next j Next i 414 Chapter 16 Here ’ s what this piece of code says: Opt i jS T n j X Terminal nodes Si j XAfte (, )max[ ( , ) , ] max[ ( , ) , ] =∗− −0 0r r vesting Si j m X Exitrate nOpt i j OpUp Down, (, ) (/ )(, )≥∗ −∗++ +111 π π tti j RAfter vesting Si j m X Exitrate n S i j X(, ) , (, ) /m a x ( , ) ,+ <∗ +∗−1 0 (() −∗++ ++(/ )(, ) (, )111 1Exitrate nOpt i j Opt i j RBefore veUp Downπ πssting⎧ ⎨⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ ⎩⎪ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪ At the terminal nodes, we simply exercise the option.

If S ( i , j ) < m * X , then the ESO ’ s payoff depends on whether the employee exits the firm or not.

Since larger values of n become time consuming, we recom- mend lower numbers. In the graph below, we show the sensitivity of the ESO value to the employee exit rate e , the rate at which employees leave the firm each year: 416 Chapter 16 The exit rate has a major effect on the value of the ESO: the higher the turnover of employees, the lower the value of the employee stock options. In terms of FASB 123 valuation, the exit rate e is an important valuation factor. Finally we do a sensitivity of the ESO value on the exit multiple m . Recall that the Hull-White model assumes that an employee holding an ESO exercises her option when the stock price is a multiple m of the option exercise price X . Basically this locks the employee into a suboptimal strategy, since in general call options should be held to maturity (though note that in this case the option is written on a stock which pays a dividend, which may in some cases make early exercise optimal). In the example below, we clearly see the sub-optimality of early ESO exercise: the higher the multiple m , the higher the value of the ESO. 1 23 4 56789 101112131415 16 1718192021 22 2324252627 28 2930313233 34 35F E D C B A e c i r p k c o t s t n e r r u C 0 5 S e c i r p e s i c r e x e n o i t p O 0 5 X ) s r a e y n i ( e s i c r e x e n o i t p o o t e m i T 0 0 0 0 . 0 1 TVesting period (years) 3.00 e t a r t s e r e t n i l a u n n A % 0 0 . 5 t s e r e t n I k c o t s f o s s e n i k s i R % 5 3 a m g i S Stock dividend rate 2.50% Annual dividend rate on stock % 0 0 . 0 1 e , e t a r t i x E Option exercise multiple, m 3.00 r a e y e n o f o s n o i s i v i d b u s f o r e b m u N 0 5 n Employee stock option value 13.5646 <-- =ESO(B2,B3,B4,B5,B6,B7,B8,B9,B10,B11) Black-Scholes call 19.1842 <-- =BSCall(B2*EXP(-B8*B4),B3,B4,B6,B7) Sensitivity of ESO value to exit rate e Exit rate, e 13.5646 <-- =B13, data table header 0% 20.1732 1% 19.3621 3% 17.8536 5% 16.4828 7% 15.2347 9% 14.0963 11% 13.0561 13% 12.1039ESO FUNCTION SENSITIVITY TO EMPLOYEE EXIT RATE e 12.0013.0014.0015.0016.0017.0018.0019.0020.0021.00 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12%ESO Exit rate, e 417 The Binomial Option Pricing Model Last But Not Least The Hull-White model is a numerical approximation of the ESO option valu- ation, but it is not a closed-form formula. A recent paper by Cvitani ć , Wiener, and Zapatero (2006) gives an analytical derivation of the value of employee stock options. The formula stretches over 16 pages of typescript and will not be given here. An Excel implementation of the formula exists and can be downloaded at http://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/ ∼ mswiener/research/ESO.htm . 16.9 Using the Binomial Model to Price Non-Standard Options: An Example The binomial model can also be used to price non-standard options.

For the case we consider, the option has the following conditions: • There are n possible exercise dates only (i.e., the option is only exercisable on these dates). • Exercise at date t precludes exercise at all dates s > t . However, if you don ’ t exercise at date s , you may still exercise at date t > s . • The exercise price at date t is X t , meaning that the exercise price can vary with time. We want to value this option using a binomial framework. To do so, we recognize that basically this is just an American option with three separate exercise prices. Here ’ s how we set this problem up in a spreadsheet, using the logic of the American option valuation described in section 16.5: 1 2 3456 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 2324 25 2627 28 29 30 313233 34 35 36 3738 39I H G F E D C B A Initial stock price 100 Exercise prices 0 0 1 1 e t a D % 0 1 p U 5 0 1 2 e t a D % 5 - n w o D 2 1 1 3 e t a D % 6 e t a r t s e r e t n I State prices q u 0.6918 <-- =(B5-B4)/((1+B5)*(B3-B4)) qd 0.2516 <-- =(B3-B5)/((1+B5)*(B3-B4)) Check1/(q u+qd) 1.06 <-- =1/(B8+B9) qu*(1+up)+q d*(1+down) 1 <-- =B8*(1+B3)+B9*(1+B4) Stock price 133.100 121.000 0 5 9 . 4 1 1 0 0 0 . 0 1 1 0 0 5 . 4 0 1 0 0 0 . 0 0 1 5 7 2 . 9 9 0 0 0 . 5 9 90.250 85.738 Date 0 Date 1 Date 2 Date 3 Value at each node 21.100 <-- =MAX(H16-E6,0) 16.000 ) 0 , 6 E - 8 1 H ( X A M = - - < 0 5 9 . 2 3 8 5 . 1 1 1 4 0 . 2 8 6 3 . 8 0 0 0 . 0 2 1 4 . 1 0.000 0.000 Early exercise? yes no no no noTIME-DEPENDENT EXERCISE PRICES =MAX(q U*H25+q D*H27,MAX(F16-E4,0)) =IF(q U*H25+q D*H27>= MAX(F16-E4,0),\"no\",\"yes\")=MAX(q U*F28+q D*F30,MAX(D19-E3,0)) 419 The Binomial Option Pricing Model Most of this spreadsheet follows section 16.5. Cells B15:H21 describe the stock price over time, which follows a binomial process with the “Up” = 1.10 and “Down” = 0.95 (cells B3 and B4).

But note that in the above picture, the exercise price varies with the date, so that the exercise price at date 3 is E5, that of date 2 is E4, and that of date 1 is E3. As you can see in cell B28, the value of the American call option is 8.368. 16.10 Summary The binomial model is intuitive and easy to implement. As a widespread alternative to Black-Scholes pricing, the model can easily be put into a spread-sheet and programmed in VBA. This chapter has explored both the basic uses of the binomial model and its implementation to price American and other non-standard options. A section on employee stock options has shown how to implement the Hull-White (2004) model for valuing these options. Through-out, we have laid special stress on the role of state prices in implementing the model. Exercises 1. A stock selling for $25 today will, in 1 year, be worth either $35 or $20. If the interest rate is 8%, what is the value today of a one-year call option on the stock with exercise price $30? Use the simultaneous equation approach of section 16.2 to price the option. 2. In exercise 1, compute the state prices q U and q D , and use these prices to calculate the value today of a one-year put option on the stock with exercise price $30. Show that 420 Chapter 16 put-call parity holds: That is, using your answer from this problem and the previous problem, show that: Call priceX rStock price today Put price ++=+1 3. In a binomial model a call option and a put option are both written on the same stock. The exercise price of the call option is 30 and the exercise price of the put option is 40. The call option ’ s payoffs are 0 and 5 and the put option ’ s payoffs are 20 and 5. The price of the call is 2.25 and the price of the put is 12.25. a. What is the riskless interest rate? Assume that the basic period is one year. b. What is the price of the stock today? 4. All reliable analysts agree that a share of ABC Corp., selling today for $50, will be priced at either $65 or $45 1 year from now. They further agree that the probabilities of these events are 0.6 and 0.4, respectively. The market risk-free rate is 6%. What is the value of a call option on ABC whose exercise price is $50 and which matures in 1 year? 5. A stock is currently selling for 60. The price of the stock at the end of the year is expected either to increase by 25% or to decrease by 20%. The riskless interest rate is 5%. Calculate the price of a European put on the stock with exercise price 55. Use the binomial option pricing model. 6.

A prominent securities firm recently introduced a new financial product. This product, called “The Best of Both Worlds” (BOBOW for short), costs $10. It matures in 5 years, at which point it repays the investor the $10 cost plus 120% of any positive return in the S&P 500 index. There are no payments before maturity. For example: If the S&P 500 is currently at 1,500, and if it is at 1,800 in 5 years, a BOBOW owner will receive back $12.40 = $10*[1 + 1.2*(1800/1500 - 1)]. If the S&P is at or below 1,500 in 5 years, the BOBOW owner will receive back $10. Suppose that the annual interest rate on a 5-year, continuously compounded, pure- discount bond is 6%. Suppose further that the S&P 500 is currently at 1,500 and that you believe that in 5 years it will be at either 2,500 or 1,200. Use the binomial option pricing model to show that BOBOWs are underpriced. 10. This problem is a continuation of the discussion of section 16.6. Show that as n → ∞ , the binomial European put price converges to the Black-Scholes put price. (Note that, as part of the chapter spreadsheet for this chapter, we have included a function called BSPut , which computes the Black-Scholes put price.) 11. Here ’ s an advanced version of exercise 10.

(The message here is that the parameterization of the binomial Up and Down is not unique.) 423 The Binomial Option Pricing Model 12. A call option is written on a stock whose current price is $50. The option has maturity of 3 years, and during this time the annual stock price is expected to increase by 25% or to decrease by − 10%. The annual interest rate is constant at 6%. The option is exercisable at date 1 at a price of $55, at date 2 for a price of $60, and at date 3 for a price of $65. What is its value today? Will you ever exercise the option early? 13. Reconsider the above problem. Show that if the date 1 exercise price is X , the date 2 exercise price is X *(1 + r ), and the date 3 exercise price is X *(1 + r ) 2 , you will not exercise the option early. 10 14. An investment bank is offering a security linked to the price 2 years from today of Bisco stock, which is currently at $3 per share. Denote Bisco ’ s stock price in two periods by S 2 . The security being offered pays off max( , ) S2340 0− . You estimate that in each of the next two periods, Bisco stock will either increase by 50% or decrease by 20%. The annual interest rate is 8%. Price the security. 10. It can also be shown that this property holds if the exercise prices grow more slowly than the interest rate. Thus for the problem considered in section 16.5, there will be early exercise of the American call only when the exercise prices grow at a rate faster than the interest rate. 1 7 The Black-Scholes Model 17.1 Overview In a path-breaking paper published in 1973, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes proved a formula for pricing European call and put options on non-dividend-paying stocks. Their model is probably the most famous model of modern finance. The Black-Scholes formula is relatively easy to use, and it is often an adequate approximation to the price of more complicated options. In this chapter we make no pretense at a full-blown development of the model; this requires a knowledge of stochastic processes, and a not-inconsiderable math-ematical investment. Instead, we shall describe the mechanics of the model and show how to implement it in Excel. We also illustrate several uses of the Black-Scholes formula in the valuation of structured assets. 17.2 The Black-Scholes Model Consider a stock whose price is lognormally distributed. 1 The Black-Scholes model uses the following formula to price European calls on a stock: C S Nd X e NdrT=−−() ()12 where dSX r T T dd T12 212=++ =−ln( ) ( )/ σ σ σ Here C denotes the price of a call, S is the price of the underlying stock, X is the exercise price of the call, T is the call ’ s time to exercise, r is the interest rate, and σ is the standard deviation of the logarithm of the stock ’ s return. N( ) denotes a value of the standard normal distribution. It is assumed that the stock will pay no dividends before date T . By the put-call parity theorem (see Chapter 15), a put with the same exercise date T and exercise price X written on the same stock will have price P = C − S + Xe − rT . Substituting for C in this equation and doing some algebra gives the Black-Scholes European put pricing formula: 1. The lognormal distribution is discussed in Chapter 26 though for purposes of applying the Black-Scholes model, section 17.4 is sufficient. 426 Chapter 17 PX e Nd S NdrT=− − −−() () 21 In Chapter 16 we hinted at one form of the proof of the Black-Scholes formula. There it was shown numerically that the Black-Scholes formula coincides with the binomial option pricing model formula when (i) the length of a typical period → 0, (ii) the “Up” and the “Down” moves in the binomial model converge to a lognormal price process, and (iii) the term structure of interest rates is flat. Implementing the Black-Scholes Formulas in a Spreadsheet The Black-Scholes formulas for call and put pricing are easily implemented in a spreadsheet. The following example shows how to calculate the price of a call option written on a stock whose current price S = 50, when the exercise price X = 45, the annualized interest rate r = 4%, and σ = 30%. The option has T = 0.75 years to exercise. All three of the parameters T , r , and σ are assumed to be in annual terms. 2 1 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16C B A S 50 Current stock price X 45 Exercise price r 4.00% Risk-free rate of interest T 0.75 Time to maturity of option (in years) Sigma 30% Stock volatility, σ d1 0.6509 <-- (LN(S/X)+(r+0.5*sigma^2)*T)/(sigma*SQRT(T)) d2 0.3911 <-- d 1-sigma*SQRT(T) N(d 1) 0.7424 <-- Uses formula NormSDist(d 1) N(d 2) 0.6521 <-- Uses formula NormSDist(d 2) Call price 8.64 <-- S*N(d 1)-X*exp(-r*T)*N(d 2) Put price 2.31 <-- call price - S + X*Exp(-r*T): by Put-Call parity 2.31 <-- X*exp(-r*T)*N(-d 2) - S*N(-d 1): direct formulaBLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING FORMULA 2. Section 26.7 in Chapter 26 discusses how to calculate the annualized σ of the lognormal process given non-annual data. 427 The Black-Scholes Model The spreadsheet calculates the put price twice: In cell B15 the put price is computed by using put-call parity, and in cell B16 it is calculated by using the direct Black-Scholes formula. We can use this spreadsheet to do the usual sensitivity analysis. For example, the following Data|Table (see Chapter 31) gives—as the stock price S varies— the Black-Scholes value of the call compared to its intrinsic value [i.e., max(S − X, 0)]. 18 19 2021 22 23 24 2526 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36CD E F G H I J K L M N Stock priceCall priceIntrinsic value 8.6434 5 50 . 0 0 0 0 0 10 0.0000 0 15 0.0000 0 20 0.0029 0 25 0.0484 030 0.3101 0 35 1.1077 0 40 2.7319 0 45 5.2777 0 50 8.6434 5 55 12.6307 10 60 17.0378 15 65 21.7056 20 70 26.5256 25 75 31.4304 30 80 36.3811 35Data table: Comparing the Black-Scholes to the intrinsic value Data table header: = B14Data table header: =Max(B2-B3,0).This is the option's intrinsic value . 0510152025303540 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 0Black-Scholes Price Versus Intrinsic Value Call price Intrinsic value 17.3 Using VBA to Define a Black-Scholes Pricing Function Although the spreadsheet implementation of the Black-Scholes formulas illus- trated in the previous section is sufficient for some purposes, we are sometimes interested in having a closed form function which we can use directly in Excel. We can do so with Visual Basic for Applications. Below we define functions dOne , dTwo , and BSCall : 428 Chapter 17 Function dOne(Stock, Exercise, Time, _ Interest, sigma) dOne = (Log(Stock / Exercise) + _ Interest * Time) / (sigma * Sqr(Time)) _ + 0.5 * sigma * Sqr(Time) End Function Function dTwo(Stock, Exercise, Time, _ Interest, sigma) dTwo = dOne(Stock, Exercise, Time, _ Interest, sigma) - sigma * Sqr(Time) End Function Function BSCall(Stock, Exercise, Time, _ Interest, sigma) BSCall = Stock * Application.NormSDist _ (dOne(Stock, Exercise, Time, Interest, _ sigma)) - Exercise * Exp(-Time * Interest) * _ Application.NormSDist(dTwo(Stock, Exercise, _ Time, Interest, sigma)) End Function Note the use of the Excel function NormSDist , which gives the standard normal distribution. 3 3. We could have used the newer version of this function, Norm.S.Dist(x,TRUE or FALSE). TRUE gives the cumulative distribution, whereas FALSE gives the probability density. It seems simpler to use the old version of this function, NormSDist , which gives the cumulative distribution. 429 The Black-Scholes Model Function BSPut(Stock, Exercise, Time, _ Interest, sigma) BSPut = BSCall(Stock, Exercise, Time, _ Interest, sigma) + Exercise * _ Exp(-Interest * Time) - Stock End Function Using These Functions in an Excel Spreadsheet Here ’ s an example of these functions used in Excel.

We can implement this in another VBA function, BSPut : 430 Chapter 17 17.4 Calculating the Volatility The Black-Scholes formula depends on five parameters: the stock price S , the option exercise price X , the option ’ s time to maturity T , the interest rate r , and the standard deviation of the returns of the stock underlying the option σ . Four of these five parameters are straightforward, but the fifth parameter, σ , is problematic. There are two common ways of computing sigma, σ : • σ can be computed based on the historical returns of the stock. • σ can be computed based on the implied volatility of the stock. In the two subsections below, we illustrate both methods of computing σ and apply them to the pricing of options on the Standard & Poor ’ s 500 (symbol SPY , called “spiders”). The Volatility of Historical Returns We can use historical stock returns to compute the volatility. The method is the following: • For a given time frame and frequency of returns, we compute the periodic volatility. The time frame commonly used varies wildly: Some practitioners use a short term of, say, 30 days, while others use a much longer (up to 1 year) time frame. Similarly, the frequency of returns can be daily, weekly, or some-times monthly. Since options are mostly short term, a shorter time frame is more common. • We annualize the periodic volatility by multiplying by the square root of the number of periods per year. Thus: σσ σ σannualmonthly weekly daily=∗ ∗ ∗⎧ ⎨⎪⎪ ⎩⎪ ⎪12 52 250 The number of days per year is an open question. Most practitioners use 250 or 252 for the number of transaction dates per year. However, instances of using 365 can also be found. 431 The Black-Scholes Model In the spreadsheet below we show one year ’ s daily prices for SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). This is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the Standard & Poor ’ s 500. The historical prices of the SPY and the resulting historical volatil-ity are computed below: 12 3 45 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20AB C D E F G H Date Adj Close Return ) C : C ( T N U O C = - - < 2 5 2 t n u o C 7 0 . 7 1 1 1 1 - t c O - 0 1 11-Oct-11 117.19 0.10% <-- =LN(B4/B3) Average daily return 0.08% <-- =AVERAGE(C:C) 12-Oct-11 118.22 0.88% <-- =LN(B5/B4) Standard deviation of daily return 1.03% <-- =STDEV.S(C:C)13-Oct-11 117.98 -0.20% 14-Oct-11 120 1.70% Annualized mean return 0.99% <-- =12*G4 17-Oct-11 117.71 -1.93% Annualized sigma 16.34% <-- =SQRT(252)*G5 18-Oct-11 120.01 1.94% 19-Oct-11 118.59 -1.19% ) 5 5 2 C : 0 3 1 C ( T N U O C = - - < 6 2 1 t n u o C % 4 4 . 0 1 1 . 9 1 1 1 1 - t c O - 0 2 21-Oct-11 121.37 1.88% Average daily return 0.05% <-- =AVERAGE(C130:C255) 24-Oct-11 122.86 1.22% Standard deviation of daily return 0.87% <-- =STDEV.S(C130:C255) 25-Oct-11 120.47 -1.96% 26-Oct-11 121.69 1.01% Annualized mean return 0.59% <-- =12*G12 27-Oct-11 125.93 3.42% Annualized sigma 13.76% <-- =SQRT(252)*G13 28-Oct-11 125.9 -0.02% 31-Oct-11 122.87 -2.44% 1-Nov-11 119.44 -2.83%2-Nov-11 121.39 1.62%Return statistics, one yearSPY HISTORICAL PRICES, DAILY DAT A Return statistics, last half year The historical volatility based on a full year of data is 16.34%, whereas the volatility for the last 6 months is 13.76%. The Implied Volatility The implied volatility ignores history; instead it determines the option σ based on actual option prices. Whereas the historical volatility is a backward-looking volatility, the implied volatility is a forward-looking estimate. 4 To estimate the implied volatility for the SPY calls expiring 19 January 2013, we solve the Black-Scholes formula for the sigma, which gives the current market price: 4. The nomenclature “forward-looking” versus “backward-looking” makes it sound as if the implied volatility is always better than the historical. This is, of course, not the intention. 432 Chapter 17 The implied volatility is 15.22% for the call and 16.54% for the put. As shown in cells B14 and B17, these volatilities, when inserted in the Black- Scholes formula, give back the current market price. We have used functions CallVolatility and PutVolatility described below. Pricing At-the-Money SPY Options When we price the SPY at-the-money options for all maturities at the historical volatility, we see that the Black-Scholes model with the full-year ’ s historical volatility as a proxy for σ does a reasonable job of pricing the calls: 1 23456 7 89 1011121314 15 1617C B A Current date 09-Oct-12 Option expiration date 19-Jan-13 Current SPY price, S 144.2 Option strike price, X 144 Time to maturity, T 0.279452 <-- =(B3-B2)/365 % 8 0 . 0 e t a r t s e r e t n I 4 7 . 4 e c i r p l l a c l a u t c A 1 9 . 4 e c i r p t u p l a u t c A Implied call volatility 15.22% <-- =CallVolatility(B5,B6,B7,B8,B10) Proof: Black-Scholes call price 4.74 <-- =BSCall(B5,B6,B7,B8,B13) Implied put volatility 16.54% <-- =PutVolatility(B5,B6,B7,B8,B11) Proof: Black-Scholes put price 4.91 <-- =BSPut(B5,B6,B7,B8,B16)IMPLIED VOLATILITY FOR THE JANUARY 2013 SPY OPTIONS 1 234 5 6 7 89 10111213 14 151617 18 19H G F E D C B A Current date 09-Oct-12Current SPY price, S 144.2Exercise price, X 144 Sigma, σ 16.34% <-- =SPY!G8 ExpirationMarket priceInterest rateTime to maturity, TBS, historical sigmaImplied volatility 20-Oct-12 1.40 0.08% 0.0301 1.73 <-- =BSCall($B$3,$B$4,D8,C8,$B$5) 12.99% <-- =CallVolatility($B$3,$B$4,D8,C8,B8) 17-Nov-12 2.80 0.08% 0.1068 3.18 <-- =BSCall($B$3,$B$4,D9,C9,$B$5) 14.33% <-- =CallVolatility($B$3,$B$4,D9,C9,B9) % 5 7 . 4 1 4 3 . 4 7 2 0 2 . 0 % 8 0 . 0 3 9 . 3 2 1 - c e D - 2 2 % 0 4 . 4 1 9 5 . 4 4 7 2 2 . 0 % 8 0 . 0 6 0 . 4 2 1 - c e D - 1 3 % 2 2 . 5 1 8 0 . 5 5 9 7 2 . 0 % 8 0 . 0 4 7 . 4 3 1 - n a J - 9 1 % 3 2 . 5 1 0 3 . 6 9 2 3 4 . 0 % 8 0 . 0 8 8 . 5 3 1 - r a M - 6 1 % 8 5 . 5 1 5 5 . 6 8 5 6 4 . 0 % 2 1 . 0 5 2 . 6 3 1 - r a M - 8 2 % 7 0 . 7 1 2 0 . 8 4 1 0 7 . 0 % 2 1 . 0 7 3 . 8 3 1 - n u J - 2 2 % 0 2 . 7 1 1 1 . 8 8 7 1 7 . 0 % 2 1 . 0 3 5 . 8 3 1 - n u J - 8 2 % 4 7 . 6 1 3 3 . 9 7 0 5 9 . 0 % 2 1 . 0 5 5 . 9 3 1 - p e S - 1 2 % 4 6 . 7 1 5 4 . 9 3 5 7 9 . 0 % 2 1 . 0 8 1 . 0 1 3 1 - p e S - 0 3 % 1 0 . 8 1 5 8 . 0 1 7 6 7 2 . 1 % 8 1 . 0 3 9 . 1 1 4 1 - n a J - 8 1PRICING THE SPY AT-THE-MONEY OPTIONS Historical and Implied volatility 433 The Black-Scholes Model The historical volatility does a good job of pricing the call options: 02468101214Actual Call Price versus Black-Scholes using Historical σ Market price BS, historical sigma 0246810121416Actual Put Price versus Black-Scholes Price using Historical s Market price BS, historical sigma SPY data for puts produce similar, though less good, results: 434 Chapter 17 We also compute the implied volatilities of the at-the-money puts and calls: 0%5%10%15%20%25%20-Oct-1219-Nov -1219-Dec-1218-Jan-1317-Feb-1319-Mar- 1318-Apr-1318-May- 1317-Jun-1317-Jul-1316-Aug-1315-Sep -1315-Oct -1314-Nov -1314-Dec-1313-Jan-14Comparing Implied Put and Call Vola Ɵlity Implied call volaƟlity Implied put vola Ɵlity Comparing Historical with Implied Volatility It is impossible to say which of these two methods is better for pricing options. On the one hand it is common to attribute to the historical returns some kind of validity as a predictor of the future anticipated returns. On the other hand the implied volatility gives a good indication of what the market is currently thinking. Our advice: Use them both and compare. 17.5 A VBA Function to Find the Implied Volatility We design a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) function which computes the implied volatility. To do this, we first note that the option price is a mono-tonic and increasing function of the sigma: Here ’ s a Data|Table from our basic Black-Scholes spreadsheet: 435 The Black-Scholes Model We use VBA to define a function CallVolatility , which finds the σ for a call option. The function is defined as CallVolatility(Stock, Exercise, Time, Interest, Target) , where the definitions are: Stock is the stock price S Exercise is the option ’ s exercise price X Time is the time to the option ’ s maturity T Interest is the interest rate r Target is the call price C The function finds σ for which the Black-Scholes formula = C . 1 23456789 10111213141516 17 1819202122232425262728D C B A S 45 Current stock price X 50 Exercise price T 1 Time to maturity of option (in years) r 8.00% Risk-free rate of interest Sigma 30.00% Stock volatility Call price 4.88 <-- =BSCall(B2,B3,B4,B5,B6) Data table: Call price as function of volatility s 4.8759 <-- =B8, table header 15% 2.1858 16% 2.364617% 2.543718% 2.722919% 2.9023 20% 3.0817 21% 3.261222% 3.440723% 3.620224% 3.799725% 3.979226% 4.158727% 4.3381BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICE IS MONOTONIC IN SIGMA 1.802.102.402.703.003.303.603.904.204.50 15% 18% 21% 24% 27%BS call price Volatility, sCall Price and Volatility 436 Chapter 17 Function CallVolatility(Stock, Exercise, Time, _ Interest, Target) High = 2 Low = 0 Do While (High - Low) > 0.0001 If BSCall(Stock, Exercise, Time, Interest, _ (High + Low) / 2) > Target Then High = (High + Low) / 2 Else: Low = (High + Low) / 2 End If Loop CallVolatility = (High + Low) / 2 End Function The technique used by the function is very similar to the technique used in trial and error: We start with two estimates for the possible σ : A High estimate of 100% and a Low estimate of 0%. We now do the following: • Plug the average of the High and the Low into the Black-Scholes formula. This gives us CallOption(Stock, Exercise, Time, Interest, (High + Low) / 2) . (Note the function CallVolatility assumes that the function CallOption is available to the spreadsheet.) • I f CallOption(Stock, Exercise, Time, Interest, (High + Low) / 2 > Target , then the current σ estimate of (High + Low) / 2) is too high and we replace High by (High + Low) / 2 . • I f CallOption(Stock, Exercise, Time, Interest, (High + Low) / 2 < Target , then the current σ estimate of (High + Low) / 2) is too low and we replace Low by (High + Low) / 2 . We repeat this procedure (often called the bisection method) until the dif- ference High-Low is less than 0.0001 (or some other arbitrary constant). 437 The Black-Scholes Model 17.6 Dividend Adjustments to the Black-Scholes The Black-Scholes formula assumes that the option ’ s underlying security pays no dividends prior to the exercise date T . In certain cases it is easy to make an adjustment to the model for dividends. This section looks at two such adjustments: We first look at option pricing when future dividends are known with certainty, and we then examine option pricing when the underlying secu-rity pays out a continuous dividend. The principle underlying both cases is the same: The options are priced on an adjusted underlying value which nets out the present value of dividends paid between the option purchase date and the option exercise date. A Known Dividend to Be Paid Before the Option Expiration It often happens that a stock ’ s future dividend is known at the time the option is traded. This is most commonly the case when a dividend has already been announced, but it can also happen because many stocks pay quite regular and relatively inflexible dividends. In this case the option should be priced not on the current stock price S but on the stock price minus the present value of the dividend or dividends anticipated before the option expiration date T : Time 0Time t Dividend paymentTime T Option expiration Stock price = S Div Max[S T - X,0] Stock price minus PV(dividend) = S – Div*exp[-rt] Here ’ s an example: Coca-Cola (stock symbol KO) pays quarterly dividends in the middle of March, June, September, and November of each year. Divi- dends (see Figure 17.1 ) seem quite stable; on 28 July 2006, the last two divi-dends have been $0.31 per share. Figure 17.1 Yahoo data for Coca-Cola. Note the stability of the dividends. On 28 July 2006, the closing stock price is $44.52. 439 The Black-Scholes Model Computing the implied volatility for the January 2007 calls and puts on Coca-Cola shows that taking account of anticipated dividends makes a signifi- cant difference in the pricing. We can also deduce from the proximity of the prices which take dividends into account (cells B19:B20) versus the distance between the prices which do not take the dividends into account (cells B22:B23) that the former are correct. 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 131415 16 171819 20 21 22 23E D C B A 6 0 - l u J - 8 2 e t a d t n e r r u C Option expiration date 19-Jan-07 2 5 . 4 4 e c i r p k c o t s t n e r r u C % 0 0 . 5 e t a r t s e r e t n I DateAnticipated dividendPresent value Mid September 13-Sep-06 0.31 0.31 <-- =C8*EXP(-$B$5*((B8-$B$2)/365)) End November 29-Nov-06 0.31 0.30 <-- =C9*EXP(-$B$5*((B9-$B$2)/365)) Stock price net of PV(dividends) 43.91 <-- =B4-SUM(D8:D9) y e n o m e h t t a y l e t a m i x o r p p A - - < 0 0 . 5 4 X , e c i r p e s i c r e x E Time to maturity, T 0.4795 <-- =(B3-B2)/365 t s e r e t n i f o e t a r e e r f - k s i R % 0 0 . 5 r , e t a r t s e r e t n I 6 0 l u j 8 2 n o e c i r p l l a C - - < 0 8 . 1 e c i r p l l a C 6 0 l u j 8 2 n o e c i r p t u P - - < 5 8 . 1 e c i r p t u P Implied volatility Call, S net of dividends 14.95% <-- =CallVolatility(B11,B12,B13,B14,B15) Put, S net of dividends 15.15% <-- =PutVolatility(B11,B12,B13,B14,B16) Call, S with dividends 12.19% <-- =CallVolatility(B4,B12,B13,B14,B15) Put, S with dividends 17.45% <-- =PutVolatility(B4,B12,B13,B14,B16)PRICING THE COCA-COLA JAN07 CALLS AND PUTS Dividend Adjustments for Continuous Dividend Payouts—The Merton Model In the above subsection we looked at the case of known future dividends. This subsection discusses a model due to Merton (1973) for the pricing options on a stock which pays continuous dividends. Continuous dividends may seem an odd assumption. But a basket of stocks such as the S&P 500 index or the Dow Jones 30 can best be approximated by the assumption of a continuous dividend payout, since there are many stocks and since the index components more or less pay out their dividends throughout the year. Assuming the continuous dividend yield of k , Merton proved the following call option pricing formula: 440 Chapter 17 CS e N d X e N dkT rT=−−−() () ,12 where dSX r k T T dd T12 212=+− + =−ln( / ) ( ) σ σ σ This model is used below to price the exchange-traded fund which tracks the S&P 500 index: 1 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17C B A e c i r p k c o t s t n e r r u c 8 9 . 7 2 1 S e c i r p e s i c r e x e 0 0 . 7 2 1 X 6 0 - l u J - 8 2 e t a d s ' y a d o t , 7 0 - r a M - 6 1 s e r i p x e n o i t p o - - < 9 2 3 6 . 0 T t s e r e t n i f o e t a r e e r f - k s i r % 0 0 . 5 r d l e i y d n e d i v i d % 0 7 . 1 k y t i l i t a l o v k c o t s % 4 1 a m g i S d1 0.3122 <-- =(LN(B2/B3)+(B5-B6+0.5*B7^2)*B4)/(B7*SQRT(B4)) d2 0.2008 <-- =B9-B7*SQRT(B4) N(d 1) 0.6226 <--- Uses formula NormSDist(d 1) N(d 2) 0.5796 <--- Uses formula NormSDist(d 2) 1 5 . 7 e c i r p l l a C <-- S*Exp(-k*T)*N(d 1)-X*exp(-r*T)*N(d 2) y t i r a p l l a C - t u P y b : ) T * r - ( p x E * X + ) T * k - ( p x E * S - e c i r p l l a c - - < 4 9 . 3 e c i r p t u P 3.94 <-- X*exp(-r*T)*N(-d 2)-S*Exp(-k*T)*N(-d 1): direct formulaMERTON'S DIVIDEND-ADJUSTED OPTION PRICING MODEL used here to price S&P 500 Spiders (symbol: SPY) The Merton model is often used to price currency options. Suppose we take an option on the euro. The option specifies a dollar exchange rate for euros (in the example below, the call option lets us buy 10,000 euros in 0.0575 years for $1.285 per euro). The asset underlying the option is a euro interest-bearing security with interest rate r € . 441 The Black-Scholes Model 17.7 Using the Black-Scholes Formula to Price Structured Securities A “structured security” is Wall Street parlance for securities which incorporate combinations of stocks, options, and bonds. In this section we give three examples of such securities and show how to price them using the Black-Scholes model. 5 In the process we also return to the discussion of Chapter 16, showing how the profit diagrams of option strategies can help us understand such securities. A Simple Structured Security: Principal Protection Plus Participation in Market Upside Moves A simple and popular structured offers guaranteed return of the investor ’ s principal plus some participation in the upside moves of the market. Here ’ s an example: Homeside Bank offers its customers the following “Principal-Protected, Upside Potential” security (PPUP). • Initial investment in the security: $1,000. • No interest paid on the security. • In 5 years the PPUP pays back the $1,000 plus 50% of the increase in the S&P 500 index. Writing the index price today as S 0 and the index price in 5 years as S T , the payoff on the PPUP can be written as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17D C B A o r u e e n o f o e c i r p r a l l o d .

The euro pays a dividend, which is the euro interest rate. Therefore the Merton model applies, with the underlying asset price being S*exp(- r €*T), where r€is the interest rate on euros. Note also the change in d1, where rUS-r€appears instead of rUSas in the regular Black-Scholes formula. 5. Not all structureds can be priced using Black-Scholes; more complicated, path-dependent, securities often need to be priced using the Monte Carlo methods discussed in Chapters 24 and 25. 442 Chapter 17 $ , % max ,1 000 1 50 1 0 0+∗ −⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥S S T To analyze the PPUP, we first rewrite the maturity payment as: $ , % max , $,1 000 1 50 1 0 1 0000+∗ −⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥ = ↑S ST Payoff on zero c ooupon bondPayoff on at-the-m/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/dncurlybracketright+∗ ∗ − ↑$,%max( , ) 1 000500 00SSST ooney call option/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext /dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext This shows that the PPUP payoff is composed of two parts: • A $1,000 return of principal.

A Reverse Convertible: Analyzing the UBS “Goals” The Swiss bank UBS has issued a series of stock-linked securities called “Goals.” All of the Goals pay interest on the initial price; the final repayment depends on the market price of the underlying stock: If the stock price is high, the Goals investor gets back her initial investment, and if the stock price is low, the Goals investor is paid out in a package of shares whose value is less than her initial investment. An example of such a security is the Cisco-linked Goals issued by UBS on 17 January 2001. The main details of this security are: • The purchaser pays UBS $1,000 on 23 January 2001. In return, she gets 3 payments of $97.50 =∗⎛ ⎝⎞⎠19 50 21 000.%$, on 23 July 2001, 23 January 2002, and 23 July 2002. 1 2 3 4 5 6789 10 11 1213 14 151617181920 21 22 2324 25 2627H G F E D C B A Stoxx50 price today, S 0 2,158.0 X1 1,618.50 X2 2,158.0 0 . 0 0 0 , 1 Y % 0 0 . 7 r , s r a e y 5 r o f e t a r t s e r e t n i e e r f - k s i R 5 T , y t i r u t a m o t e m i T % 5 7 . 5 1 a m g i s , 0 5 x x o t S e h t f o y t i l i t a l o V Airbag components, value today Bond paying X 1 at maturity 704.69 <-- =EXP(-B6*B7)*B5 Y/X 1 * written puts with exercise X 1 -4.69 <-- =-B5/B3*BSPut(B2,B3,B7,B6,B8) Purchased call with exercise X 2 320.01 <-- =B5/B4*BSCall(B2,B4,B7,B6,B8) ) 3 1 B : 1 1 B ( M U S = - - < 0 0 . 0 2 0 1 y a d o t y t i r u c e s d e r u t c u r t s f o e u l a V Time to maturity, T 1020.00 54321 0 . 0 0 0 1 5% 1000.02 1000.07 1000.20 1000.59 1001.77 1000.20 10% 1004.57 1006.22 1008.40 1011.13 1013.78 1000.40 15% 1017.84 1021.09 1024.72 1028.28 1029.65 1000.59 20% 1031.11 1035.21 1039.61 1043.69 1044.54 1000.79 Volatility of the Stoxx50, sigma --> 25% 1040.84 1045.48 1050.44 1055.14 1056.54 1000.99 30% 1047.16 1052.22 1057.69 1063.09 1065.58 1001.19 35% 1050.86 1056.29 1062.26 1068.39 1072.19 1001.39 40% 1052.66 1058.44 1064.88 1071.75 1076.95 1001.59 45% 1053.10 1059.19 1066.10 1073.70 1080.28 1001.79 50% 1052.55 1058.94 1066.29 1074.59 1082.53 1001.99ABN-AMRO AIRBAG SENSITIVITY TO TIME TO MATURITY AND SIGMA Data table header:=B14 451 The Black-Scholes Model • On 23 July 2002, in addition to the $97.50 payment ° If the price of Cisco stock > $39 per share, the purchaser of the security gets $1,000. ° If the price of Cisco stock < $39 per share, the purchaser gets 1 000 3925 641,.= shares of Cisco. • The closing stock price of Cisco on 23 January 2001 was 42.625. • The continuously compounded risk-free interest rate at the time of the Goals issuance was 5.2% annually (2.6% semiannually). To analyze the Cisco-linked Goals, we start by noting that the cash flow can be written as: Time 0 1 2 3 -1,000 97.50 97.50 97.50 1,000-25.641*Max(39-S T,0) To prove this, we write a short spreadsheet which compares the Goals payoff per definition with its payoff as described above: 452 Chapter 17 The equivalence of these two definitions means that the purchaser of the Cisco-linked Goals: • Acquires a $1,000 bond paying 9.75% interest semi-annually. • Writes UBS 25.641 puts with exercise X = 39 and with time to maturity T = 1.5. At the time the Goals were issued, the semi-annual interest rate was around 2.6%, far below 9.75%. Thus the bond component of the Goals was worth much more than $1,000. On the other hand, the purchaser of the Goals was giving UBS 25.641 puts. The value of this “gift” should be accounted for in any analysis of the Goals. We illustrate two ways to value the Goals. The first method assumes that the equilibrium NPV of any security should be zero.

The implied volatility of Cisco stock during this period varied between 80% and 120%. 454 Chapter 17 There is another way to look at the Goals. Consider a Goals purchaser who buys the Goals and also buys 25.641 puts on Cisco with T = 1.5, X = 39.

Given a 2.6% semi-annual discrete interest rate, it would be technically more correct to use an equivalent continuously compounded interest rate of LN((1.026)^2) in the option computations. The reader can confirm that the effect of this correction is negligible. 455 The Black-Scholes Model Payoff Goals putsST +=−∗ − ↑ 25 6411 000 25 641 39 .$, .

Clearly this return is less than the alternative risk-free rate of return (5.2%), which can be earned in the market. This is an alternative confirmation of the fact that the Goals are a bad buy. 456 Chapter 17 THE SEC FILING FOR UBS AG $60,000,000 GOALS UBS AG $60,000,000 19.5% GOALs DUE JULY 23, 2002 ------------------------------------------------------------------ Each note being offered has the following terms: - - Issuer: UBS AG - - Issue: $60,000,000 USD principal amount of GOALs due July 23, 2002 linked to shares in the common stock of Cisco Systems, Inc. - - Coupon: 19.5% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on each January 23 and July 23 which shall be composed of (1) an interest coupon representing a rate of 5.2% per annum and (2) a coupon representing an option premium of 14.3% per annum - - Initial price of $39.00 per share, subject to underlying stock antidilution adjustments (strike price): - - Key dates: Trade: January 17, 2001 Settlement: January 23, 2001 Determination: July 18, 2002 Maturity: July 23, 2002 Proceeds at maturity are based on the closing price of Cisco Systems, Inc. common stock three business days before maturity: If the closing price of Cisco Systems, Inc. common stock is at or above the initial price per share of $39.00, holders will receive a cash payment equal to the principal amount of their GOALs. If the closing price of Cisco Systems, Inc. is lower than the initial price per share of $39.00, holders will receive 25.641 shares of Cisco Systems, Inc. common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of their GOALs (the stock redemption amount). Fractional shares will be paid in cash. The number of shares received for each $1,000 invested will be calculated by dividing the initial price per share of $39.00 into $1,000. The stock redemption amount and the initial price per share of $39.00 (strike price) may change due to stock splits or other corporate actions.

Suppose that you are convinced that a given stock will go up in a very short period of time. You want to buy calls on the stock that have a maximum “bang for the buck”—that is, you want the percentage profit on your option invest-ment to be maximal. Using the Black-Scholes formula, it is easy to show that you should: • Buy calls with the shortest possible maturity. • Buy calls that are most highly out of the money (i.e., with the highest exer- cise price possible).

Letting F stand for the forward price of an asset, the Black-Scholes equation given in section 17.2 is replaced by 7. This section is advanced and can be skipped on first reading. A full discussion of the pricing of options on bonds is beyond the scope of the current edition of this book. However, this very useful and often-used adaptation of the Black model is simple enough to attach to this chapter. 460 Chapter 17 Ce F N d X N drT=−−[( ) ( ) ] , 12 where dFX T T dd T12 212=+ =−ln( / ) σ σ σ The corresponding put price is given by: Pe X Nd F NdrT=− − −−[( ) ( ) ] 21 To use the Black (1976) model, consider the case of an option on a zero coupon bond, where the option maturity is T = 0.5. The option gives the holder the opportunity to buy the bond at time T for exercise price X = 130. Suppose that the risk-free interest rate is r = 4%. If the forward price of the bond to the exercise date is F = 133 and the volatility of the forward price is σ = 6%, then the pricing of the bond option using the Black (1976) model is given below. 1 2345 6 7 8 9 10 11 12C B A F 133.011 <-- Bond forward price X 130.000 <-- Exercise price t s e r e t n i f o e t a r e e r f - k s i R - - < % 0 0 . 4 r 5 . 0 T Sigma 6%<-- Bond forward price volatility, σ d1 0.5609 <-- =(LN(B2/B3)+B6^2*B5/2)/(B6*SQRT(B5)) d2 0.5185 <-- =B8-SQRT(B5)*B6 Call price 4.13 <-- =EXP(--B4*B5)*(B2*NORMSDIST(B8)-B3*NORMSDIST(B9)) Put price 1.02 <-- =EXP(-B4*B5)*(B3*NORMSDIST(-B9)-B2*NORMSDIST(-B8))USING THE BLACK (1976) MODEL TO PRICE A BOND OPTION Thus a call on the bond is worth 4.13 and a put is worth 1.02. Determining the Bond ’ s Forward Price The forward interest rate is the interest rate which can be locked in today for a loan in the future. In the example below, the current 7-year rate is 6% and the 4-year rate is 5%. By simultaneously creating a deposit in one maturity 461 The Black-Scholes Model and a loan in the other maturity, we create a security which has zero cash flows everywhere except at years 4 and 7: 1 2 34 5 6 7 89 10 11 12 13 14 151617 18 1920 21J I H G F E D C B A 7 W , y t i r u t a m d n o B 4 T , y t i r u t a m n o i t p O % 6 e t a r t n u o c s i d e r u p W r a e Y % 5 e t a r t n u o c s i d e r u p T r a e Y Discretely-compounded interest rates 012345678 6 3 . 0 5 1 - 0 0 . 0 0 1 % 0 0 . 6 t a t i s o p e d r a e y - 7 5 5 . 1 2 1 0 0 . 0 0 1 - % 0 0 . 5 t a n a o l r a e y - 4 Sum of above: A 3-year deposit at year 4 6 3 . 0 5 1 - 5 5 . 1 2 1 0 0 . 0 Discretely compounded forward interest rate from year 4 to year 7 7.35% <-- =(-I11/F11)^(1/(B2-B3))-1 Continuously-compounded interest rates 012345678 0 2 . 2 5 1 - 0 0 . 0 0 1 % 0 0 . 6 t a t i s o p e d r a e y - 7 4 1 . 2 2 1 0 0 . 0 0 1 - % 0 0 . 5 t a n a o l r a e y - 4 Sum of above: A 3-year deposit at year 4 0 2 . 2 5 1 - 4 1 . 2 2 1 0 0 . 0 Continuously compounded forward interest rate from year 4 to year 7 7.33% <-- =LN(-I19/F19)/(B2-B3)THE FORWARD INTEREST RATE The spreadsheet above shows two forward rate computations.

The formula is widely used both to price options and as a conceptual framework for analyzing complex securities. In this chapter we have explored the implementation of the Black-Scholes formula. Using “plain vanilla” Excel allows us to price Black-Scholes options; using VBA we are able define both the Black-Scholes price and the implied volatility for options. Finally, we showed how to use Black-Scholes to price structured products—combinations of options, stocks, and bonds. Exercises 1. Use the Black-Scholes model to price the following: • A call option on a stock whose current price is 50, with exercise price X = 50, T = 0.5, r = 10%, σ = 25%. • A put option with the same parameters. 463 The Black-Scholes Model 2. Use the data from exercise 1 and Data|Table to produce graphs that show: • The sensitivity of the Black-Scholes call price to changes in the initial stock price S . • The sensitivity of the Black-Scholes put price to changes in σ . • The sensitivity of the Black-Scholes call price to changes in the time to maturity T . • The sensitivity of the Black-Scholes call price to changes in the interest rate r . • The sensitivity of the put price to changes in the exercise price X . 3. Produce a graph comparing a call ’ s intrinsic value [defined as max( S − X , 0)] and its Black-Scholes price. From this graph you should be able to deduce that it is never optimal to exercise early a call priced by the Black-Scholes. 4. Produce a graph comparing a put ’ s intrinsic value [ = max( X − S ,0)] and its Black-Scholes price. From this graph you should be able to deduce that it may be optimal to exercise early a put priced by the Black-Scholes formula. 5. The table below gives prices for American Airlines (AMR) options on 12 July 2007. The option with exercise price X = $27.50 is assumed to be the at-the-money option. a.

Use the Excel Solver to find the stock price for which there is the maximum difference between the Black-Scholes call option price and the option ’ s intrinsic value. Use the fol- lowing values: S = 45, X = 45, T = 1, σ = 40%, r = 8%. 8. As shown in this chapter, Merton (1973) shows that for the case of an asset with price S paying a continuously compounded dividend yield k , this leads to the following call option pricing formula: CS e N d X e N dkT rT=−−−() () ,12 where dSX r k T T dd T12 212=+− + =−ln( / ) ( ) σ σ σ a.

On 12 July 2007 call and put options to purchase and sell 10,000 euros at $1.37 per euro are traded on the Philadelphia options exchange. The options’ expiration date is 20 Decem-ber 2007. If the dollar interest rate is 5%, the euro interest rate is 4.5% and the volatility of the euro is 6%, what should be the price of a call and a put? 10.

Consider a structured security of the following type: The purchaser invests $1,000 and in three years gets back the initial investment plus 95% of the increase in a market index whose current price is 100. The interest rate is 6% per year, continuously compounded. Assuming the security is fairly priced, what is the implied volatility of the market index? 1 8 Option Greeks 18.1 Overview In this chapter we discuss the sensitivities of the Black-Scholes formula to its various parameters. The “Greeks,” as they are called (because of the Greek letters used to denote most of them), are the partial derivatives of the Black-Scholes formula with respect to its arguments. They can be thought of as giving a measure of the riskiness of an option: • Delta, denoted by Δ , is the partial derivative of the option price with respect to the price of the underlying stock price: ΔΔCall PutSS=∂ ∂=∂ ∂Call Put, . Delta, Δ , can be thought of as a measure of the variability of the option ’ s price when the price of the underlying changes. • Gamma, Γ , is the second derivative of the option ’ s price with respect to the underlying stock. Gamma gives the convexity of the option price with respect to the stock price. For options priced by the Black-Scholes formula, the call and put have the same gamma: ΓΓCall PutSS=∂ ∂==∂ ∂2 22 2Call Put . • Vega is the sensitivity of the option price to the standard deviation of the underlying stock ’ s return σ : For no obvious reason, the Greek letter kappa, κ , is sometimes used to denote vega. Given the Black-Scholes formula, calls and puts have the same vega: κσσ=∂ ∂=∂ ∂Call Put . • Theta, θ , is change in the option ’ s value as the time to maturity decreases. We generally expect that options become less valuable with the passage of time (though this turns out not to be always true). Writing T as the option ’ s remaining time to maturity, we set theta equal to the negative of the derivative of the option price with respect to T : θθCall PutTT=−∂ ∂=−∂ ∂Call Put, . • Rho, ρ , measures the interest rate sensitivity of an option: ρρCall Putrr=−∂ ∂=−∂ ∂Call Put, . In this chapter we show you how to measure an option ’ s Greeks and how to use them in hedging. For generality we illustrate using the Merton model (Chapter 17, section 6), an extended version of the Black-Scholes formula which applies to both stocks paying a continuous dividend or to currencies. 468 Chapter 18 18.2 Defining and Computing the Greeks The “Greeks” are the sensitivities of an option price with respect to certain of its variables. In the table below we set out the Greeks for options defined on an underlying which pays a continuous dividend. As discussed in section 17.6, such options are priced using the Merton model. Of course, the standard Black-Scholes model is obtained from the Merton model by setting the dividend yield k = 0. Currency options can be priced by the Merton formula by setting S = current exchange rate, X = option exercise exchange rate, r = domestic interest rate, and k = foreign interest rate. The Merton version of the Black-Scholes formula is given by: CS e N d X e N d PS e N dX e N d kT rT kT rT=− =− − + −−− −−() () () ()12 12 where dS Xrk T T dd T12 212 =⎛ ⎝⎞⎠+− + =−ln ( / ) σ σ σ The table on page 469 gives the Greeks for this formula. The appendix to this chapter gives the VBA implementations of these functions. 469 Option Greeks Black-Scholes Greeks Measures Call Put Delta, written as either Δ or δ Price sensitivity of option ∂ ∂V S Δ Call = e − kT N ( d 1 ) Δ Put = e − kT ( N ( d 1 ) − 1) = − e kT N ( − d 1 ) Gamma, written as Γ Second-order price sensitivity ∂ ∂2 2V S .

The idea is to replicate an option by a portfolio of stocks and bonds, with the portfolio pro-portions determined by the Black-Scholes formula. Suppose we decide to replicate an at-the-money European call option which has 12 weeks to run until expiration. The stock on which the option is written has S 0 = $40 and exercise price X = $35, the interest rate is r = 4%, and the stock ’ s volatility is σ = 25%.

At each subsequent date t, the stock position is adjusted to St*Δcall. The bond position is adjusted so that the net cash flow of the portfolio is zero. At the final date, the stock and bond portfolios are liquidated. 1. This topic is discussed again in Chapter 29. 475 Option Greeks Note that we use the formula BSMertoncall but with the dividend yield k = 0%, so that this is, in effect, a regular BS call option. In the spreadsheet above, we create this option by replicating, on a week- to-week basis, the BS option pricing formula using delta hedging. • At the beginning, 12 weeks before the option ’ s expiration, we determine our stock/bond portfolio according to the formula Call SN d Xe N drT=−−() ()12 , so that we have a dollar amount SN d()1 of shares in the portfolio and have borrowing of Xe N drT−()2 . Having determined the portfolio holdings at the beginning of the 12-week period, we now determine our portfolio holdings for each of the successive weeks as follows: • In each successive week we set the stock holdings in the portfolio according to the formula SN d() 1 , but we set the portfolio borrowing so that the net cash flow of the portfolio is zero. Note that SN d S Call ()1=Δ , hence the name “delta hedging.” • At the end of the 12-week period, we liquidate the portfolio. The delta hedge would be perfect if we rebalanced our portfolio continu- ously. However, here we have rebalanced only weekly. Had we a perfect hedge, the portfolio would have paid off max[ , ] SXTerminal − 0 (cell B27); the actual hedge payoff (cell B28) is slightly different. Using the technique of Data Table on a blank cell explained in Chapter 31, we replicate this simula-tion to check the deviation between the desired payoff and the hedge position payoff: 476 Chapter 18 18.4 Hedging a Collar A collar is an option strategy designed to protect the holder of a package of shares against possible price losses. The usual collar is a combination of a written call plus a purchased put, designed so that the net cost of the position is zero. Thus the collar provides costless protection to its holder. Here ’ s an example: On 1 January 2008, a bank ’ s client holds 5,000,000 shares of XYZ Corp. Each share is currently worth $55. Because the stock is currently restricted, the client cannot sell the shares until 1 year from now. However, he is worried that the stock price will decline, and hence he desires to purchase a collar. The client asks an investment bank to design the following package: • He wants to buy a put on the shares with T = 1 year and exercise price x Put = $49.04 • He wants to write a call on the shares with T = 1 year and exercise price X C al l = $70.00. The exercise prices have been set so that the Black-Scholes value of the call and the put are equal: 12 1314 15 16 17 18 19 2021 22 23 24 25 26 2728 29 30 31 32 33KL M N O P Q R S T U V SimulationDelta hedge payoffMax(ST- X,0)Hedge— actual payoff 5.4024 5.3669 0.0355 <-- =L13-M13, data table header 1 3.4743 3.5591 -0.08482 0.3252 0.0000 0.3252 3 0.0971 0.0000 0.0971 4 -0.0193 0.0000 -0.0193 5 11.8112 12.2037 -0.3925 6 3.5610 3.4877 0.0733 7 10.6744 10.7604 -0.08608 8.6602 8.8020 -0.1417 9 10.3202 10.2422 0.0780 10 4.3520 4.2742 0.077711 2.3202 2.1388 0.1814 12 0.0123 0.0000 0.0123 13 6.4462 6.2541 0.1920 14 2.7854 3.5831 -0.797815 10.6339 10.7932 -0.1592 16 3.1851 3.0200 0.1651 17 1.8986 2.0582 -0.1596 18 13.6581 13.8167 -0.1586 19 7.9048 7.8179 0.0869 20 7.5720 7.6190 -0.0471-1.0-0.8-0.6-0.4-0.20.00.20.4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 01 11 21 31 41 51 61 71 81 92 02 1Hedge—Actual Payo ﬀ 477 Option Greeks Given the X C all = 70 for the call, the put exercise price was determined using Solver : 1 23456 7 89 1011121314 15D C B A Call Put 0 0 . 5 5 0 0 . 5 5 S 4 0 . 9 4 0 0 . 0 7 X 1 1 T r, interest 4.00% 4.00% k, dividend yield 0.00% 0.00%Sigma 40% 40% BS option value 4.74 4.74 <-- =bsmertonput(C3,C4,C5,C6,C7,C8) Call minus put 0.00 <-- =B10-C10 =bsmertoncall(B3,B4,B5,B6,B7,B8)COLLAR: THE PURCHASER OWNS A WRITTEN CALL AND A BOUGHT PUT 478 Chapter 18 The point of the collar is to give the purchaser upside potential with limited downside risk.

The payoffs to the holder of the collar plus the shares are never less than $49. This is, of course, the protection that the client was seeking. 479 Option Greeks A Slightly Longer Story Even though the Black-Scholes value of the collar is initially zero, actually the investment bank sold the collar to the client for $5. There are several reasons why the client might want to pay this: • Perhaps there is low liquidity in the options (this is often the case in longer- term options), so that the bank is actually supplying a valuable liquidity service. • It might be that the options do not actually exist—either because the particu- lar long-term options in question are not marketed or perhaps because there are no options on the particular underlying stock (this is often the case for specific portfolios). In this case the bank is actually creating the options under-lying the collar by creating an appropriate portfolio of stocks and bonds and by changing the portfolio proportions over time (see next subsection). The creation and constant monitoring of this portfolio is a service worth paying for. Delta Hedging the Collar: The Bank ’ s Problem The client for the collar is short a call and long a put. The bank wants to make a similar investment, so that it will parallel the client ’ s portfolio and have the money to pay off the client at the maturity of his collar.

We can use Data Table on a blank cell to show many simulations. For details see the spreadsheet for this chapter. Below we show a graph that gives the bank ’ s net profit in 21 simulations of the delta hedging strategy for the collar. 483 Option Greeks Making the Collar Gamma Neutral As the option gets closer to expiration, the hedge position can become sensitive to small changes in the stock price, meaning that the gamma of the collar can grow enormously. There are two solutions to moderate the gamma of the collar: • We can increase our hedge frequency as we get closer to the collar expiration date. • We can change our hedge strategy in order to temper the hedge gamma, as we get closer to the option maturity. Below we explore both solutions. Increasing the Hedge Frequency The main problem of the hedge seems to be for the dates close to the end of the expiration period. Since the initial options have maturity T = 1, this means that we have to be very careful during the last two months of the hedging period. Delta hedging the position more often may work, though it is easy to come up with counter-examples: -3-2-1012345 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 01 11 21 31 41 51 61 71 81 92 02 1Net Bank Pro ﬁt from Delta Hedge of Collar 21 Simula Ɵons 484 Chapter 18 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 121314 15 161718 19 20212223 24 252627 28 293031 32 333435 36 373839 40F E D C B A 0 0 . 5 5 S Xcall 70.00 Xput 49.04 % 0 0 . 4 r k, dividend yield 2.00% % 0 4 a m g i S Time until expiration Stock priceStock =- B10*(deltacall(B10,$B$3,A10,$B$5,$B$ 6,$B$7)- deltaput(B10,$B$4,A10,$B$5,$B$6,$B$ d n o B ) ) 7Porfolio valuePortfolio cash flow 0 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 9 2 . 8 1 9 2 . 8 1 - 0 0 . 5 5 0 2 . 0 0 0 . 0 7 4 . 0 0 9 . 8 1 3 4 . 8 1 - 2 6 . 3 5 9 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 3 . 0 5 8 . 7 1 5 5 . 7 1 - 2 1 . 4 5 8 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 4 1 . 0 4 7 . 6 1 0 6 . 6 1 - 5 6 . 4 5 7 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 1 5 . 1 6 9 . 2 2 4 4 . 1 2 - 5 1 . 0 5 6 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 8 0 . 1 8 5 . 0 2 9 4 . 9 1 - 8 1 . 1 5 5 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 2 5 . 1 2 7 . 2 2 0 2 . 1 2 - 5 0 . 0 5 4 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 4 0 . 1 0 8 . 9 1 6 7 . 8 1 - 0 2 . 1 5 3 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 3 2 . 1 5 6 . 0 2 2 4 . 9 1 - 1 7 . 0 5 2 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 4 0 . 2 5 1 . 6 2 1 1 . 4 2 - 1 6 . 8 4 1 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 5 9 . 0 9 4 . 9 1 5 5 . 8 1 - 3 8 . 0 5 0 1 . 0 0 0 . 0 8 0 . 2 3 7 . 8 2 5 6 . 6 2 - 5 7 . 7 4 9 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 6 6 . 3 0 7 . 7 3 4 0 . 4 3 - 4 9 . 4 4 8 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 0 9 . 2 6 3 . 5 3 6 4 . 2 3 - 7 9 . 5 4 7 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 8 3 . 6 5 7 . 5 4 7 3 . 9 3 - 6 0 . 1 4 6 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 4 8 . 6 9 5 . 6 4 5 7 . 9 3 - 0 6 . 0 4 5 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 6 0 . 9 3 3 . 7 4 7 2 . 8 3 - 5 3 . 8 3 4 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 2 8 . 0 1 0 4 . 7 4 8 5 . 6 3 - 0 6 . 6 3 3 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 6 1 . 1 1 3 4 . 7 4 7 2 . 6 3 - 8 2 . 6 3 2 0 . 0 0 0 . 0 3 7 . 1 1 5 4 . 7 4 2 7 . 5 3 - 3 7 . 5 3 1 0 . 0 * 9 2 C = - - < 1 1 . 1 1 6 3 . 6 3 0 0 . 0 B Check: Collar payoff to client at time 0 Short call payoff 0.00 <-- =-MAX(B30-B3,0) Long put payoff 12.68 <-- =MAX(B4-B30,0) ) 4 3 B : 3 3 B ( M U S = - - < 8 6 . 2 1 l a t o T Payoff to bank from delta hedge 11.11 <-- =E30 Terminal cash flow to bank -1.56 <-- =-B35+B38MODERATING THE COLLAR GAMMA This example starts with T = 0.20 and hedges every Delta_t = 0.01 485 Option Greeks Repeated simulation of this hedge shows that it works quite well.

Of course, it may not always be possible to costlessly neutral- ize the gamma. In this case we will have to make some compromises. 18.5 Summary In this chapter we have explored the sensitivities of the option pricing formula to its various parameters. Using these Greeks, we have delved into the intrica-cies of delta hedging, a useful technique for replicating an option position with 486 Chapter 18 a combination of stocks and bonds. The interested reader should know that there is much more which can be said about this topic. Good starting places for further reading are Hull (2006) and Taleb (1997). An extensive collection of option pricing formulas including Greeks can be found in Haug (2006). Exercises 1. Produce a graph similar to the second panel of Figure 18.2 for puts. 2. Figure 18.4 shows the call theta as a function of time to maturity. Produce a similar graph for puts. 3. Although θ is generally negative, there are cases (typically of high interest rates) where it can be positive: • An in-the-money put with a high interest rate • An in-the-money call on a currency which has a high interest rate (or—equivalently—an in-the-money call on a stock with a very high dividend payout rate). Find two examples. Appendix: VBA for Greeks The VBA for the Greeks used in this chapter: Black-Scholes Functions Throughout the chapter we use the Merton version of the Black-Scholes formula for pricing options with a continuous dividend yield (see Chapter 17 for details). The VBA connected with this model is given below. Function dOne(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) dOne = (Log(stock / exercise) + _ (interest - divyield) * time) / _ (sigma * Sqr(time)) + 0.5 * sigma * _ Sqr(time) End Function 487 Option Greeks Function dTwo(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) dTwo = dOne(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) - sigma * _ Sqr(time) End Function Function BSMertonCall(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) BSMertonCall = stock * Exp(-divyield * _ time) * Application.NormSDist _ (dOne(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma)) - exercise * _ Exp(-time * interest) * Application.NormSDist _ (dTwo(stock, exercise, time, interest, _ divyield, sigma)) End Function ‘Put pricing function uses put-call parity theorem Function BSMertonPut(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) BSMertonPut = BSMertonCall(stock, exercise, _ time, interest, divyield, sigma) + _ exercise * Exp(-interest * time) - _ stock * Exp(-divyield * time) End Function 488 Chapter 18 Defining the Normal Distribution The option pricing functions above use the old version of the Excel function NormSDist . In Excel 2010 and onward, there is another function Norm.S.Dist(x,False/True) . If the second parameter in this function is set to False , it computes the normal density; with the parameter set to True , it com- putes the normal distribution function. 2 The VBA writing of these functions is Application.Norm_S_Dist(x,0 or 1) . Without regard for consistency, we have used both versions of this func-tion in our VBA for Greeks. Sometimes it is convenient to use a homemade function for the normal probability density defined below: ’ The standard normal probability density, ’ this is N’(x) Function normaldf(x) normaldf = Exp(-x ∧ 2 / 2) / _ (Sqr(2 * Application.Pi())) End Function Defining the Greeks Below we give the Greeks in VBA: Function DeltaCall(stock, exercise, time, interest, _ divyield, sigma) DeltaCall = Exp(-divyield * time) * _ Application.NormSDist(dOne(stock, exercise, _ time, interest, divyield, sigma)) End Function 2. In Excel instead of False or True, we can also use 0 or 1. When using these functions in VBA, 0 or 1 is mandatory. 489 Option Greeks Function DeltaPut(stock, exercise, time, interest, _ divyield, sigma) DeltaPut = -Exp(-divyield * time) * _ Application.NormSDist(-dOne(stock, exercise, _ time, interest, divyield, sigma)) End Function In VBA there is a native function called Gamma which has nothing to do with options. Hence we use OptionGamma to define the Greek that refers to the option ’ s convexity with respect to the underlying price, ∂∂22VS . Function OptionGamma(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) temp = dOne(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) OptionGamma = Exp(-divyield * time) * _ Application.Norm_S_Dist(temp, 0) / _ (stock * sigma * Sqr(time)) End Function Function Vega(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) Vega = stock * Sqr(time) * _ normaldf(dOne(stock, exercise, _ time, interest, divyield, sigma)) _ * Exp(-divyield * time) End Function 490 Chapter 18 Function ThetaCall(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) ThetaCall = -stock * normaldf _ (dOne(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma)) * _ sigma * Exp(-divyield * time) / _ (2 * Sqr(time)) + divyield * stock * _ Application.NormSDist(dOne(stock, _ exercise, time, interest, _ divyield, sigma)) * Exp(-divyield * time) _ - interest * exercise * Exp(-interest * _ time) * Application.NormSDist _ (dTwo(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma)) End Function Function ThetaPut(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) ThetaPut = -stock * normaldf _ (dOne(stock, exercise, _ time, interest, divyield, sigma)) * _ sigma * Exp(-divyield * time) / _ (2 * Sqr(time)) - divyield * stock _ * Application.NormSDist(-dOne(stock, _ exercise, time, interest, divyield, _ sigma)) * Exp(-divyield * time) _ + interest * exercise * Exp _ (-interest * time) * Application.NormSDist _ (-dTwo(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma)) End Function 491 Option Greeks Function RhoCall(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) RhoCall = exercise * time * _ Exp(-interest * time) * _ Application.NormSDist(dTwo _ (stock, exercise, time, interest, _ divyield, sigma)) End Function Function RhoPut(stock, exercise, time, _ interest, divyield, sigma) RhoPut = -exercise * time * _ Exp(-interest * time) * _ Application.NormSDist(-dTwo _ (stock, exercise, time, interest, _ divyield, sigma)) End Function 1 9 Real Options 19.1 Overview The standard net present value (NPV) analysis of capital budgeting values a project by discounting its expected cash flows at a risk-adjusted cost of capital. This discounted cash flow (DCF) technique is by far the most widely used practice for evaluating capital projects, be they acquisitions of companies or the purchases of machines. However, standard NPV analysis does not take account of the flexibility inherent in the capital budgeting process: Part of the complexity of the capital budgeting process is that the firm can change its decision dynamically, depending on the circumstances. Here are two examples: 1. A firm is considering replacing some of its machines with a new type of machine. Instead of replacing all the machines together, it can first replace one machine. Based on the performance of the first machine replaced, the firm can then decide whether to replace the rest of the machines. This “option to wait” (or perhaps the “option to expand”) is not valued in the standard NPV process. It is essentially a call option. 2. A firm is considering investing in a project which will produce (uncertain) cash flows over time. One option—not valued in the standard NPV frame-work—is to abandon the project if its performance is not satisfactory. The abandonment option is, as we see below, a put option which is implicit in many projects. It is also sometimes called the “option to contract scale.” There are many other real options. In the leading book on the valuation of real options, Trigeorgis (1996) lists the following common real options: • The option to defer or to wait with developing a natural resource or build a plant. • The time-to-build option (staged investment): At each stage the investment can be re-evaluated and (possibly) abandoned or expanded. • The option to alter operating scale (expand, contract, shut down, or restart). • The option to abandon. • The option to switch inputs or outputs. • The growth option—an early investment in a project constitutes an option to “get into the market” at a later date. 494 Chapter 19 The recognition of real options is an important extension of the NPV tech- niques. However, modeling and valuing real options is more difficult than modeling and valuing standard cash flows by the DCF method. Our examples below illustrate these difficulties. Often it is best to implement real options by recognizing that the DCF technique misjudges the value of a project because it ignores the project ’ s real options. Our usual conclusion will be that real options add to the value of a project, and that the NPV thus underestimates the true value. 19.2 A Simple Example of the Option to Expand In this section we give a simple example of the option to expand. Consider ABC Corp., which has six widget machines. ABC is considering replacing each of the old machines with a new machine that costs $1,000. The new machines have a 5-year life. The anticipated cash flows for the new machine are given below. 1 1 2 34 5 678G F E D C B A 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y 0 5 1 0 0 2 0 0 4 0 0 3 0 2 2 0 0 0 1 - e n i h c a m e l g n i s f o F C Discount rate for machine cash flows (risk-adjusted) 12% % 6 e t a r t n u o c s i d s s e l k s i R Present value of machine's future cash flows 932.52 <-- =NPV(B5,C3:G3) 3 B + ) 3 G : 3 C , 5 B ( V P N = - - < 8 4 . 7 6 - e n i h c a m e l g n i s f o V P NTHE OPTION TO EXPAND The financial analyst working on the replacement project has estimated a cost of capital for the project of 12%. Using these anticipated cash flows and the 12% cost of capital, the analyst has concluded that the replacement of a single old machine by a new machine is unprofitable, since the NPV is negative: −++()+()+()+() ↑1000220 11 2300 11 2400 11 2200 11 2150 11 22345. ....

These cash flows are the incremental cash flow of replacing a single old machine by a new machine. The computations include taxes, incremental depreciation, and the sale of the old machine. 495 Real Options Now comes the (real options) twist. The line manager in charge of the widget line says, “I want to try one of the new machines for a year. At the end of the year, if the experiment is successful, I want to replace five other similar machines on the line with the new machines.” Does this change our previously negative conclusion about replacing a single machine? The answer is “yes.” To see this, we now realize that what we have is a package: • Replacing a single machine today. This has an NPV of − 67.48. • The option of replacing five more machines in one year. Suppose that the risk-free rate is 6%. Then we view each such option as a call option on an asset which has current value S equal to the present value of the machine ’ s future cash flows. As can be seen in cell B7 above, this present value is S = 932.52. The exercise price of this option is X = 1,000. Of course these call options can be exercised only if we purchase the first machine now. 2 Suppose we assume that the Black-Scholes option pricing model can price this option. In this case we have: 1 2 3 4 56789 1011 12 13 14 151617 18 19 20 21222324G F E D C B A 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Y 0 5 1 0 0 2 0 0 4 0 0 3 0 2 2 0 0 0 1 - e n i h c a m e l g n i s f o F C Discount rate for machine cash flows (risk-adjusted) 12% % 6 e t a r t n u o c s i d s s e l k s i R Present value of machine's future cash flows 932.52 <-- =NPV(B5,C3:G3) 3 B + ) 3 G : 3 C , 5 B ( V P N = - - < 8 4 . 7 6 - e n i h c a m e l g n i s f o V P N 5 r a e y t x e n t h g u o b s e n i h c a m f o r e b m u N Option value of single machine purchased in one more year 143.98 <-- =B24 1 1 B * 0 1 B + 8 B = - - < 9 3 . 2 5 6 t c e j o r p l a t o t f o V P N Black-Scholes Option Pricing Formula s F C e n i h c a m f o V P 2 5 . 2 3 9 S t s o c e n i h c a M = e c i r p e s i c r e x E 0 0 . 0 0 0 1 X t s e r e t n i f o e t a r e e r f - k s i R % 0 0 . 6 r ) s r a e y n i ( n o i t p o f o y t i r u t a m o t e m i T 1 T y t i l i t a l o V - - < % 0 4 a m g i S d1 0.1753 <-- (LN(S/X)+(r+0.5*sigma^2)*T)/(sigma*SQRT(T)) d2 -0.2247 <-- d 1 - sigma*SQRT(T) N(d 1) 0.5696 <--- Uses formula NormSDist(d 1) N(d 2) 0.4111 <--- Uses formula NormSDist(d 2) 8 9 . 3 4 1 e c i r p l l a c S B = e u l a v n o i t p O <-- S*N(d 1)-X*exp(-r*T)*N(d 2)THE OPTION TO EXPAND 2. What we ’ re really doing is pricing the cost of learning! 496 Chapter 19 As cell B12 shows, the value of the whole project is 652.39. Our conclusion: Buying one machine today, and knowing that we have the option to purchase five more machines in one year is a worthwhile project. One critical element here is the volatility. The lower the volatility (i.e., the lower the uncertainty), the less worthwhile this project is: 27 28 293031 32 3334 35 363738 39 404142BC D E F G HI σ 652.39 <-- =B12 , data table header 1% -63.48 10% 97.1620% 283.09 30% 468.40 40% 652.3950% 834.59 60% 1,014.54 70% 1,191.81Data Table Project Value as Function of Sigma -20002004006008001,0001,2001,400 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% Sigma This is not very surprising: The value of the project as a whole comes from our uncertainty about the actual cash flows 1 year from now. The less this uncertainty is (measured by σ ), the less valuable the project will be. Sidebar: Is Black-Scholes the Appropriate Valuation Tool for Real Options? The answer is almost certainly no: Black-Scholes is not the appropriate tool. However, the Black-Scholes model is by far the most numerically tractable (i.e., easiest) model we have for valuing options of any kind. In valuing real options we often use the Black-Scholes model, realizing that at best it can give an approximation to the actual option value. Such is life. Having said this, you should realize that the assumptions of the Black- Scholes option valuation model—continuous trading, constant interest rate, no exercise before final option maturity—are not really appropriate to the real options considered in this chapter. In many cases real options involve what, in 497 Real Options a securities option context, would be considered dividend-paying securities and/or early exercise. Two examples: • The staged-investment real option, when we have the opportunity to expand or contract the investment over time, is intrinsically an option with early exercise. • When an option to abandon an investment exists, as long as the investment is still in place and not abandoned, it continues to pay “dividends,” in the form of cash flows. We can only hope that the Black-Scholes model gives an approximation to the option value intrinsic in the real options. 19.3 The Abandonment Option Consider the following capital budgeting project: 7 8 9 10 11 12 1314 15ABCDE Project cash flows 150 100 80 -50 80 -50 -60 As you can see, the initial cost of this project is 50. In one period the project will produce cash flows of either $100 or − $50; that is, under certain circum- stances, it will lose money. Two periods hence the project again has chances of either losing money (in the worst case) or making money. Valuing the Project In order to value the project, we use the state prices from option pricing. 3 The state price q u is the price today of $1 to be paid in the succeeding period in 3. See discussion below on how to calculate these state prices. 498 Chapter 19 The methodology is to calculate state-dependent present value factors (how this is done is discussed below) and to multiply these factors times the indi- vidual state-dependent cash flows. Each node of the tree is discounted by the relevant state price for the node; for example the cash flow of 80 which occurs at date 2 is discounted by q U q D . The NPV of the project is the sum of all the discounted cash flows plus the initial cost (cell B31). The Abandonment Option Can Enhance Value Now suppose that we can abandon the project at date 1 if its cash flow “threat-ens” to be − 50; suppose, furthermore, that this abandonment means that all subsequent cash flows will also be zero. As the picture below shows, this option to abandon the project enhances its value: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 1011 12 13141516 17 18192021 22 23242526 27 28293031AB C D E F G H I J K L s e c i r p e t a t S a t a d t e k r a M Expected market return 12% qU 0.3087 <-- =(1+B5-B9)/((1+B5)*(B8-B9)) Sigma of market return 30% qD 0.6347 <-- =(B8-1-B5)/((1+B5)*(B8-B9)) % 6 e t a r e e r f - k s i R One-period \"up\" and \"down\" of market ) 4 B ( P X E = ' p U ' s i e v i t a n r e t l a d i l a v a t a h t e t o n , ) 4 B + 3 B ( P X E = - - < 2 6 9 1 2 5 . 1 p U ) 4 B - ( P X E = ' n w o D ' s i e v i t a n r e t l a d i l a v a t a h t e t o n , ) 4 B - 3 B ( P X E = - - < 7 2 5 3 8 . 0 n w o D s r o t c a f e u l a v t n e s e r p t n e d n e p e d - e t a t S s w o l f h s a c t c e j o r P 2 ^ 3 E = - - < 3 5 9 0 . 0 0 5 1 7 8 0 3 . 0 0 0 1 4 E * 3 E = - - < 9 5 9 1 . 0 0 8 1 0 5 - 4 E * 3 E = - - < 9 5 9 1 . 0 0 8 7 4 3 6 . 0 0 5 - 2 ^ 4 E = - - < 8 2 0 4 . 0 0 6 - State-by-state present value 14.2981 <-- =E14*K14 30.8740 15.6755 <-- =E16*K16 -50 15.6755 <-- =E18*K18 -31.7328 -24.1673 <-- =E20*K20 Net present value -29.38 <-- =SUM(A23:E29)PRICING AN ABANDONMENT OPTION =C15*I15the “up” state; and the price q d is the price today of $1 to be paid in the “down” state. The spreadsheet fragment below shows all the relevant details, leading to a project valuation of − $29.38 (implying rejection of the project): 499 Real Options Thinking about this further, it is clear that it might even be worthwhile to pay to abandon the project . Here ’ s what the project looks like when we pay $10 to abandon it in the troublesome state (this payment can be thought of as representing the cost of closing down a facility, etc.): 34 35363738394041 42 434445AB C D E F G H I J K L t n e m n o d n a b a h t i w e u l a v t n e s e r P t n e m n o d n a b a h t i w s w o l f h s a C 4 1 K * 6 3 E = - - < 1 8 9 2 . 4 1 0 5 1 0 4 7 8 . 0 3 0 0 1 6 1 K * 8 3 E = - - < 5 5 7 6 . 5 1 0 8 0 5 - 0 5 - 0 0 0 0 0 0 Present value with abandonment 10.85 <-- =SUM(G36:K42) 3435363738394041 42 434445AB C D E F G H I J K L t n e m n o d n a b a h t i w e u l a v t n e s e r P t n e m n o d n a b a h t i w s w o l f h s a C 4 1 K * 6 3 E = - - < 1 8 9 2 . 4 1 0 5 1 0 4 7 8 . 0 3 0 0 1 6 1 K * 8 3 E = - - < 5 5 7 6 . 5 1 0 8 0 5 - 0 5 - 0 0 6 6 4 3 . 6 - 0 1 - 0 0 Present value with abandonment 4.50 <-- =SUM(G36:K42) Abandonment When We Sell the Equipment Another possibility is, of course, that “abandonment” means selling the equip- ment.

We assume that in each period the market portfolio (by which we mean some large, diversified stock market portfolio such as the S&P 500) moves either “Up” or “Down”; the size of these moves is determined by the mean return μ of the market portfolio and by the standard deviation σ of the market portfolio ’ s returns. Assuming that the returns on the market portfolio have mean μ = 12% and standard deviation of returns σ = 30%, we have—in the above examples—calculated Up Down =+ [] == − [] = exp . , exp . μσ μσ 15 3 08 4 Denote by q U the price today for one dollar in the “Up” state in one period and denote by q D the price today for one dollar in the “Down” state in one period. Then—as explained in Chapter 16—the state prices are calculated by solving the system of linear equations: 1 1 1=∗+∗ +=+qU p q D o w n rqqUD UD The solution to this system of equations is: qRD o w n RU pD o w nqUp R RU pD o w nUD=− ∗−()=− ∗−(), This method is illustrated in the above spreadsheet: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9AB C D E F G H I s e c i r p e t a t S a t a d t e k r a M Expected market return 12% qU 0.3087 <-- =(1+B5-B9)/((1+B5)*(B8-B9)) Sigma of market return 30% qD 0.6347 <-- =(B8-1-B5)/((1+B5)*(B8-B9)) % 6 e t a r e e r f - k s i R One-period \"up\" and \"down\" of market ) 4 B ( P X E = ' p U ' s i e v i t a n r e t l a d i l a v a t a h t e t o n , ) 4 B + 3 B ( P X E = - - < 2 6 9 1 2 5 . 1 p U ) 4 B - ( P X E = ' n w o D ' s i e v i t a n r e t l a d i l a v a t a h t e t o n , ) 4 B - 3 B ( P X E = - - < 7 2 5 3 8 . 0 n w o D 501 Real Options Alternative State Price Determinations An alternative method of calculating the state prices is to try to match them to the project ’ s cost of capital. Reconsider the project discussed above, and suppose that the actual probability of each state ’ s occurrence is ½. Further-more, suppose that the risk-free rate is 6%. Finally, assume that the project ’ s discount rate—if it has no options whatsoever—is 22%. Then we can calculate the project ’ s NPV without real options as 12.48: 1 2 34567 8 9 1011121314 15 1617181920 21 22 23AB C D E F G H Project cost of capital 22% <-- This is the discount rate for the project if it has no options Risk-free rate 6% Project cash flows 150 100 80 -50 80 -50 -60 Project expected cash flows : Assumes equal state probabilities 2 1 0 r a e Y Expected CF -50 25 62.5 Project NPV 12.48 <-- =NPV(B2,C17:D17)+A9 State prices qU 0.4241 <-- =1/(1+B3)-B23 qD 0.5193 <-- Determined by SolverMATCHING THE STATE PRICES TO THE COST OF CAPITAL =AVERAGE(C7:C1) =AVERAGE(E6:E12) In cells B22 and B23 we look for state prices q U and q D , which have two properties: 1. They are consistent with the risk-free interest rate. This means that qqRUD+= =11 10 6. . 2. The state prices give the same NPV for the project as that calculated by the cost of capital. 502 Chapter 19 The second requirement means that we have to use the Excel Solver to determine the state prices.

However, Excel ’ s Goal Seek does not remember its previous set- tings, meaning that each time you repeat this calculation you will have to reset the cell references. Here ’ s what the Goal Seek dialog box looks like: 19.4 Valuing the Abandonment Option as a Series of Puts The example above shows how and why the abandonment option can have value. It also illustrates another, more troublesome, feature of the abandonment option, namely, that it may be very difficult to value. While it is difficult enough to project expected cash flows, it is even more difficult to project state-by-state cash flows and state prices for a complex project. A possible compromise in the valuation of an abandonment option is to value a project as a series of cash flows plus a series of Black-Scholes put options. Consider the following example: You are valuing a 4-year project with the expected cash flows given below and with a risk-adjusted discount rate of 12%. As you can see, the project has a negative NPV: 1 2 34 5 6 7F E D C B A Project cash flows Year 01234 0 0 4 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 5 7 - w o l f h s a C Risk-adjusted discount rate 12% The project's cost of capital ) 4 F : 4 C , 6 B ( V P N + 4 B = - - < 3 5 . 3 3 - s n o i t p o t u o h t i w V P NSTANDARD DCF PROJECT VALUATION 504 Chapter 19 Suppose that we can abandon the project at the end of any of the next 4 years, selling the equipment for 300. Although this abandonment option is an American option and not a Black-Scholes option, we value it as a series of Black-Scholes put options. In each case we suppose that we first get the year-end cash flow; we then value the abandonment option on the remaining project value. • End of year 1 : The asset ’ s expected value at the end of year 1 will be the discounted value of its future expected cash flows: 702 44 . = 200 11 2300 11 2400 11 223. ..+()+() . The abandonment option means that we can get $300 for the asset during the next 3 years. Suppose that the value has a volatil-ity of 50%; then valuing this option as a Black-Scholes put with 1 year to maturity gives its value as 19.53.

It is common understanding that the value 4. A version of this example originally appeared in Benninga and Tolkowsky (2002). 506 Chapter 19 of those firms is in their future cash-flow opportunities. Therefore, understand- ing the translation of qualitative investment opportunities into quantitative valuation is of great importance when valuing those firms. In this section we use the real option method to value a biotechnology project and to illustrate the application of the real option approaches. Consider the following story. 5 A firm is considering the initiation of research into a new drug. It knows that there are three stages to the drug ’ s development: • In the discovery phase , the firm does preliminary research about the viabil- ity of the idea. This research takes 1 year and costs $1,000 at the beginning of the year. With 50% probability the results will be positive enough to proceed to the next stage of research. • If the discovery phase yields success, then the drug goes into the clinical phase , in which the drug is tested. This stage lasts 1 year and costs $2,000 at the beginning of the year, and with a probability of 30% yields enough positive results to proceed to the next stage. • If the drug passes the clinical phase successfully, then it goes into the market stage , in which it is sold. This phase costs $15,000 per year (at the beginning of each year) and on average lasts 5 years. On average, a successful drug can be expected to start the marketing phase with income of $20,000. This income grows with annual mean 10% and standard deviation σ = 100%. The expected return on a project of this type is 25%. We assume that this is the cost of capital of the project in the case of a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation. 5. We have made the story simple enough to fit an understandable spreadsheet. For a somewhat more complicated story in the same spirit, see Kellogg and Charnes (2000). 507 Real Options Since the project ’ s net present value is negative, the DCF approach indicates that it should not be undertaken. Using a Real Options Approach An alternative method for estimating the present value of proceeds is to plot the project ’ s cash flows on a binomial tree.

As explained in Chapter 16, in the standard binomial model, the state price for a node is qqt jUj Dnj() ∗()⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟− , where n is the time at which the node occurs, j is the number of Up steps needed to get to the node, and t j⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ is the number of paths to reach the node. The latter expression is computed in Excel by using the function Combin(n,j) . However, for the real options model above, the number of paths to each node is slightly different, since the beginning of the tree (the initial and clinical states) are accessible via only one path. In the spreadsheet above, the prices q U and q D were computed (using Solver ) so that the present value of the project on the binomial tree equals that of the DCF valuation and that the equilibrium condition qqUD+=1 10 6. holds. 510 Chapter 19 The Real Options Approach The real options approach to R&D recognizes that at each stage in the project, the managers can choose whether to continue the project or not. They do this by comparing the value and costs of continuation. In option terminology, at each stage, the manager exercises her continuation option if the value from exercising the option exceeds the exercise price. In the spreadsheet below, we have eliminated obvious negative cash flows from the marketing stage, taking Here ’ s the Solver screen: 511 Real Options Another Note About State Prices When we eliminate states in the real option approach, we must also adjust the number of paths to each node to account for the fact that some states are no longer reachable. This has been done in the above spreadsheet. For example the state in cell J32 (highlighted) is now reachable by one fewer path. 19.6 Summary Recognizing that capital budgeting should include option aspects of projects is clear and obvious. Valuing these options is often difficult. In this chapter we have tried to emphasize the intuitions and—insofar as is possible—to give some implementation of the valuation. 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2122 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 394041 42 43 44K J I H G F E D C B A Marketing phase, Initial revenue 20,000 The expected return and variance of return : y b n e v i g s i 0 0 0 , 5 1 t s o c l a u n n a , g n i t e k r a M % 0 1 d e t c e p x E 0 0 0 , 2 t s o c l a u n n a l a c i n i l C Initial, annual cost 1,000 σ 100% % 0 0 3 p U % 1 4 n w o D State prices q u 0.2816 q d 0.6618 Net cash flows 1,614,017 <-- =B2*B7^4-B3 527,253 3 B - 8 B * 3 ^ 7 B * 2 B = - - < 4 6 4 , 5 0 2 0 0 5 , 5 6 1 45,083 58,386 3 B - 2 ^ 8 B * 2 ^ 7 B * 2 B = - - < 6 3 8 , 4 1 8 2 4 , 9 0 0 0 , 5 -2,000 -2,000 -1,000 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 e n i l e m i T State prices (to start of market phase) 0.0001 <-- =B11^J27 0.0005 ) 1 - ) 3 , 4 ( N I B M O C ( * 2 1 B * 6 ^ 1 1 B = - - < 0 1 0 0 . 0 8 1 0 0 . 0 0.0063 0.0059 ) 2 - ) 1 , 4 ( N I B M O C ( * 2 * 2 1 B * 5 ^ 1 1 B = - - < 7 4 0 0 . 0 7 6 1 0 . 0 3 2 2 0 . 0 0.079316 0.2816 1 Binomial tree valuation 229 <-- =SUMPRODUCT(B14:J25,B30:J41)BIOTECH PROJECT, OPTION-ADJUSTED BINOMIAL TREE FOR THE CASH FLOWScare to also eliminate the subsequent cash flows and to make an adjustment to the state prices (more on that below): 512 Chapter 19 Exercises 1.

Would you recommend buying just one machine, if there are no options effects? b. Your purchase manager recommends buying one machine today and then—after seeing how the machine operates—reconsidering the purchase of the other 9 machines in 6 months. Assuming that the cash flows from the machines have a standard deviation of 30% and that the risk-free rate is 10%, value this strategy. 2. Your company is considering the purchase of a new piece of equipment. The equipment costs $50,000 and your analysis indicates that the PV of the future cash flows from the equipment is $45,000. Thus the NPV of the equipment is − $5,000. This estimated NPV is based on some initial numbers provided by the manufacturer plus some creative thinking on the part of your financial analyst. The seller of the new piece of equipment is offering a course on how it works. The course costs $1,500. You estimate that the σ of the equipment ’ s cash flows is 30%, the risk-free rate is 6%, and you will have another half year after the course to purchase the equipment at the price of $50,000. Is it worth taking the course? 3. Consider the project whose cash flows are given below: 1 23 4 5 6 789AB C D E F G H Project cash flows 169 State prices 130 qU 0.3000 91 qD 0.5000 -100 91 70 -90 a.

If there exists an abandonment option so that we can change all negative cash flows to zero, value the project. IV V ALUING BONDS Chapters 20–23 cover topics related to bonds and term structure. Chapters 20 and 21 concentrate on the classic duration and immunization formulations. In Chapter 20 we develop the basic Macaulay duration concept. Excel ’ s Duration( ) formula is somewhat cumbersome to use; we use VBA to build a new, easier-to-use formula. Chapter 21 discusses the use of duration to immunize bond portfolios. Chapter 22 shows how to model the term structure using a variety of methods; most of the chapter concentrates on the Nelson-Siegel term structure model. Chapter 23 uses a Markov process and much information about default probabilities and bond recovery ratios to model the expected rate of return on a risky corporate bond. 2 0 Duration 20.1 Overview Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a bond to changes in the interest rate at which the bond is discounted. It is widely used as a risk measure for bonds—the higher a bond ’ s duration, the more risky it is. In this chapter we consider a basic duration measure—Macaulay duration—which is defined for the case when the term structure is flat. In Chapter 21 we examine the uses of duration in immunization strategies. Consider a bond with payments C t , where t = 1, … , N. Ordinarily, the first N − 1 payments will be interest payments, and C N will be the sum of the repayment of principal and the last interest payment. If the term structure is flat and the discount rate for all of the payments is r , then the bond ’ s market price today will be PC rt t tN = +()=∑1 1 The Macaulay duration measure (throughout this chapter and the next, when we use the word duration we shall always refer to this measure) is meant to represent the time-weighted average maturity of the payments received from the bond. It is defined as: DPtC rt t tN = +()=∑1 1 1 In section 20.3 we go deeper into the meaning of this formula. Before doing this, however, we show how to calculate the duration in Excel. 20.2 Two Examples Consider two bonds. Bond A has just been issued. Its face value is $1,000, it bears the current market interest rate of 7%, and it will mature in 10 years. Bond B was issued 5 years ago, when interest rates were higher. This bond has $1,000 face value and bears a 13% coupon rate. When issued, this bond had a 15-year maturity, so its remaining maturity is 10 years. Since the current market rate of interest is 7%, bond B ’ s market price is given by $, .$ .$, .1 421 41130 10 710 0 10 7 110 10=()+() =∑ t t 518 Chapter 20 It is worthwhile calculating the duration of each of the two bonds (just once!) the long way. We set up a table in Excel.

To look at this another way, the net present value of bond A ’ s first-year payoff ($70) represents 6.54% of the bond ’ s price, whereas the net present value of bond B ’ s first-year payoff ($130) is 8.55% of its price. The figures for the second-year payoffs are 6.11% and 7.99%, respectively. (For the second-year figures, you have to divide the appropriate line of the above spreadsheet by 2, since in the duration formula each payoff is weighted by the period in which it is received.) Using the Excel Duration Formula Excel has two duration formulas, Duration( ) and MDuration( ) . MDuration — somewhat inaccurately termed Macaulay duration by Excel—is defined as: 519 Duration MDurationDuration YTM Number of coupon payments per year= +⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ 1 Both formulas have the same syntax; for example, for Duration( ) the syntax is: Duration(settlement, maturity, coupon, yield, frequency, basis) where settlement is the settlement date (i.e., the purchase date) of the bond maturity is the bond ’ s maturity date coupon is the bond ’ s coupon yield is the bond ’ s yield to maturity frequency is the number of coupon payments per year basis is the “day count basis” (i.e., the number of days in a year). This is a code between 0 and 4: 0 or omitted US (NASD) 30/360 1 Actual/actual 2 Actual/360 3 Actual/365 4 European 30/360 The Duration formula gives the standard Macaulay duration. The MDuration formula can be used in calculating the price elasticity of the bond (see section 20.3). These two duration formulas may require a bit of trickery to implement, because they demand a date serial number for both the settlement and the maturity. In the spreadsheet above, the Excel formula is implemented in cell C21 by assuming that bond A ’ s settlement date (for our purposes: the current date) is 3 December 1996 and that the bond ’ s maturity date is 3 December 2006. The choice of dates is arbitrary. The last parameter of the Excel duration formula, which gives the basis, is optional and could be omitted. The insertion of serial date formats in the Excel Duration formula is often unhandy. Later in this chapter we use VBA to define a simpler duration formula which overcomes this problem and which also computes the duration 520 Chapter 20 of a bond when bond payments are unevenly spaced. This “homemade” dura- tion formula is called DDuration . The programming aspects of this function are discussed in section 20.6. The previous spreadsheet illustrates this function in cells B21 and B24. The dialog box for DDuration ’ s computation of the duration of bond B is given below: The parameter TimeFirst is the time from the bond purchase date until the first payment. For the examples of bond A and bond B, this parameter is 1. 20.3 What Does Duration Mean? In this section we present three different meanings of duration. Each is inter-esting and important in its own right. Duration as the Time-Weighted Average of the Bond ’ s Payments This was the original definition of Macaulay (1938). Rewrite the duration formula as follows: DPtC rCP rtt t tN t t tN = +()= +()∗ ==∑∑1 11 11 521 Duration The bracketed terms CP rt t1+()⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥ sum to 1. This follows from the definition of the bond price; each of these terms is the proportion of the bond ’ s price rep- resented by the payment at time t . In the duration formula, each of the terms CP rt t1+()⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥ is multiplied by its time of occurrence: Thus, the duration is the time-weighted average of the bond ’ s discounted payments as a proportion of the bond ’ s price. Duration as the Bond ’ s Price Elasticity with Respect to Its Discount Rate This way of viewing duration explains why the duration measure can be used to measure the bond ’ s price volatility; it also shows why duration is often used as a risk measure for bonds. To derive this interpretation, we take the derivative of the bond ’ s price with respect to the current interest rate: dP drtC rt t tN =− +()+ =∑11 1 A little algebra shows that: dP drtC rDP rt t tN =− +()=−++ =∑1 11 1 which transforms into two useful interpretations of duration: • First, duration can be regarded as the elasticity of the bond price with respect to the discount factor , where by “discount factor” we mean 1 + r : dP P dr rchange in bond price change in discount factorD/ /% % 1 +()== − • Second, we can use duration to measure the price volatility of a bond, by rewriting the previous equation as: dP PDdr r=−+1 To show this interpretation of duration in a spreadsheet, we go back to the examples of the previous section. Suppose that the market interest rate rises by 10%, from 7% to 7.7%. What will happen to the bond prices? The price of bond A will be 522 Chapter 20 $.$ .$, .952 3970 1 0771 000 1 077 110 10=()+() =∑ t t A similar calculation shows the price of bond B to be $, .$ .$, .1 360 50130 1 0771 000 1 077 110 10=()+() =∑ t t As predicted by the price-volatility formula, the changes in the bond prices are approximated by ΔΔPD P r r≅− + /( )1 .

(Note that the PVIF is given by the Excel formula PV(r,N,-1) .) • In many cases the current yield of the bond, y , is not greatly different from its yield to maturity r . In these cases, duration is not very different from (1 + r ) PVIF . Unlike the two previous interpretations, Babcock ’ s formula holds only for the case of a bond with constant coupon payments and single repayment of principal at time N ; that is, the formula does not extend to the case where the payments C t differ over time.

This is almost invariably the case for bonds, except for the first payment . For example, consider a bond that pays interest on 1 May of each of the years 1997, 1998, … , 2010, with repayment of its face value on the last date. All the payments are spaced 1 year apart; however, if this bond is purchased on 1 September 1996, then the time to the first payment is 8 months (September to May), not 1 year. We shall refer to such a bond as a bond with uneven payments . In this section we discuss two aspects of this (extremely common) problem: • The calculation of the duration of such a bond, when the YTM is known. We show that the duration has a very simple formula, related to the duration 526 Chapter 20 of a bond with even payments (i.e., the standard duration formula). In the process of the discussion we develop a simpler duration formula in Excel. • The calculation of the YTM of a bond with uneven payments. This requires a bit of trickery, and ultimately leads us to another VBA function. Duration of a Bond with Uneven Payments Consider a bond with N payments, the first of which occurs at time α < 1, and the rest of which are evenly spaced. In the derivation which follows, we show that the duration of such a bond is given by the sum of two terms: • First term: The duration of a bond with N payments spaced at even intervals (i.e., the standard duration discussed above). • Second term: α − 1 It is relatively simple to show why this is so. Denote the payments on the bond by C α , C α + 1 , C α + 2 , … , C α + N − 1 , where 0 < α < 1. The price of the bond is given by: PC rrC rt t tN t t tN = +()=+() +()+− +− =− +− =∑∑α αα α 1 1 11 1 1 11 1 The duration of this bond is given by: DPtC rt t tN =+−() +()+− +− =∑11 11 1 1α α α Rewrite this last expression as follows: DPrtC rC rt t tN t t tN =+() +()+−() +()⎧ ⎨⎩⎫⎬ − +− =+− =∑∑11 11 11 1 11 1α αα α ⎭ ⎭ = +()+()+() +()+− − +− =− +− =∑∑1 1 11 1 1 1 11 1 1rC rrtC r t t tNt t tN α αα αα 1 1 1 1 111 1 1 11() +()⎧⎨⎩⎫⎬ ⎭ = + ()+()+− = +− =+−∑ ∑C r C rtC rt t tN t t tNtα αα t t tN =∑⎧ ⎨⎩⎫⎬ ⎭+− 11α 527 Duration Here is an example of the calculation of the duration of a bond with uneven periods.

We have already 528 Chapter 20 Function DDuration(NumPayments, CouponRate, _ YTM, TimeFirst) price = 1 / (1 + YTM) ∧ NumPayments DDuration = NumPayments / (1 + YTM) ∧ _ NumPayments For Index = 1 To NumPayments price = CouponRate / (1 + YTM) ∧ _ Index + price Next Index For Index = 1 To NumPayments DDuration = CouponRate * Index / _ (1 + YTM) ∧ Index + DDuration Next Index DDuration = DDuration / price + _ TimeFirst - 1 End Function Our homemade formula DDuration requires only the number of payments on the bond, the coupon rate, and the time to the first payment α . The use of the formula is illustrated in the previous spreadsheet, in cell C17. Calculating the YTM for Uneven Periods As the discussion above shows, the calculation of duration requires us to know the bond ’ s yield to maturity (YTM); this YTM is just the internal rate of return of the bond ’ s payments and its initial price. Often the YTM is given, but when it is not, we cannot use Excel ’ s IRR function but must instead use the XIRR function. Consider a bond that currently costs $1,123 and which pays a coupon of $89 on each of the next 1 January. On 1 January 2001, the bond will pay $1,089, the sum of its annual coupon and its face value. The current date is 3 introduced a simpler duration formula using VBA; the syntax of this formula is DDuration(numPayments, couponRate, YTM, timeFirst) : 529 Duration October 1996. The problem in finding the YTM of this bond is that while most of the bond payments are spaced 1 year apart, there is only 0.2466 of a year until the first coupon payment (0.2466 = (Date(1997,1,1)-Date(1996,10,3))/ 365). Thus we wish to use Excel to solve the following equation: −+ +()+ +()=+ =∑ 1 12389 11089 100 2466 03 4 2466,..YTM YTMt t To solve this problem, we can use the Excel function XIRR : 1 23456789 101112131415161718AB C D Current date 3-Oct-96 Annual coupon 89 Paid January 1 for each of next 5 years Maturity date 1-Jan-01 Face value 1,000 Price of bond 1,123 Time to first payment 0.2466 <-- =(B12-B11)/365 Date Payment 3-Oct-96 -1,123 1-Jan-97 891-Jan-98 891-Jan-99 891-Jan-00 891-Jan-01 1,089 YTM 7.300% <-- =XIRR(C11:C16,B11:B16)USING XIRR TO CALCULATE THE IRR WITH UNEVEN PAYMENTS To use the XIRR function, you first have to make sure that the Analysis ToolPak is loaded into Excel. Go to File|Options|Add-Ins|Manage . This brings up the following menu, in which you have to make sure that Analysis ToolPak is checked: 530 Chapter 20 You can now use XIRR , which returns the internal rate of return for a schedule of cash flows that is not necessarily periodic. To use this function you have to specify the list of cash flows and the list of dates. As in the case of the Excel function IRR , You can also provide a guess for the IRR, although this may be left out. 1 Calculating the YTM for Uneven Payments Using a VBA Program If you do not know the payment dates, you can use VBA to calculate the YTM for a series of uneven payments. The program below is composed of two functions. The first function, annuityvalue , calculates the value 1 11+()=∑rt tN . The second function, unevenYTM , uses the simple bisection technique to calculate the YTM of a series of uneven payments, leaving you to choose the accuracy epsilon of the desired result: 1. There is also a function XNPV for finding the present value of a series of payments paid out at uneven dates. This function is discussed in Chapter 33. 531 Duration Function Annuityvalue(interest, numPeriods) annuityvalue = 0 For Index = 1 To numPeriods annuityvalue = annuityvalue + 1 / _ (1 + interest) ∧ Index Next Index End Function Function UnevenYTM(CouponRate, FaceValue, _ BondPrice, NumPayments, TimeFirst, epsilon) Dim YTM As Double high = 1 low = 0 While Abs(annuityvalue(YTM, _ NumPayments) * CouponRate * _ FaceValue + FaceValue / _ (1 + YTM) ∧ NumPayments - _ BondPrice / (1 + YTM) ∧ _ (1 - TimeFirst)) > = epsilon YTM = (high + low) / 2 If annuityvalue(YTM, NumPayments) * _ CouponRate * _ FaceValue + FaceValue / (1 + YTM) _ ∧ NumPayments - BondPrice / _ (1 + YTM) ∧ (1 - TimeFirst) > 0 _ Then low = YTM Else high = YTM End If Wend UnevenYTM = (high + low) / 2 End Function 532 Chapter 20 Here ’ s an illustration of the use of this function: 1 2 345678 9 10 111213141516171819202122232425262728293031C B A Coupon rate 7.90% Face value 1,000.00 Bond price 1,123.00 Number of payments 5 Time to first payment 0.25 n o i t a l u c l a c M T Y e h t f o y c a r u c c a e h t s l o r t n o C - - < 1 0 0 0 0 . 0 n o l i s p E ) 8 B , 7 B , 6 B , 5 B , 4 B , 3 B ( M T Y n e v e n u = - - < % 8 3 1 . 6 M T YThis spreadsheet illustrates the unevenYTM VBA function: the syntax of this function is unevenYTM (CouponRate,FaceValue,BondPrice,NumPayments,TimeFirst,epsilon)ILLUSTRATION OF CALCULATION OF YTM OF UNEVEN PERIODS 533 Duration We can, of course, use the DDuration function in conjunction with UnevenYTM to compute the duration: 1 2 3 456789 1011C B A Coupon rate 7.90% Face value 1,000.00 Bond price 1,123.00 Number of payments 5 Time to first payment 0.25 n o i t a l u c l a c M T Y e h t f o y c a r u c c a e h t s l o r t n o C - - < 1 0 0 0 0 . 0 n o l i s p E ) 7 B , 6 B , 5 B , 4 B , 3 B , 2 B ( M T Y n e v e n u = - - < % 8 3 1 . 6 M T Y ) 6 B , 9 B , 2 B , 5 B ( n o i t a r u d d = - - < 9 5 9 5 . 3 n o i t a r u DUSING DDURATION AND UNEVENYTM TOGETHER 20.6 Non-Flat Term Structures and Duration In a general model of the term structure, payments at time t are discounted by rate r t , so that the value of a bond is given by: PC rt tt tN = +()=∑1 1 The duration measure discussed in this chapter assumes either a flat term structure (i.e., r t = r for all t ) or a term structure which shifts in a parallel fashion. When the term structure exhibits parallel shifts, we can write the bond price as: PC rtt tt tN = ++()=∑1 1 Δ and then derive a measure of duration by taking the derivative with respect to Δ t . A general model of the term structure should explain how the discount rate r t for time- t payments comes about, and how the rates at time t change. This is a difficult problem, discussed in Chapters 22 and 23. Does this mean that the simple duration measure we present in this chapter is useless? Not necessarily. It may be that the Macaulay duration measure gives a good approximation for changes in bond value as a result of changes in the 534 Chapter 20 term structure, even for the case when the term structure itself is relatively complex and not flat. 2 In this section, we explore this possibility, using data from a file of term structures developed by Prof. J. Huston McCullogh, which is on the disk that accompanies this book. 3 The file contains monthly informa- tion on the term structure of interest rates in the United States for the period 12.1949 to 2.87 (i.e., December 1949–February 1987). A typical row of this file looks like: 0 mo 1 mo 2 mo 3 mo 4 mo 5 mo 6 mo 12.1946 0.18 0.32 0.42 0.48 0.52 0.55 0.58 9 mo 1 yr 2 yr 3 yr 4 yr 5 yr 10 yr 15 yr 20 yr 0.65 0.72 0.95 1.15 1.3 1.41 1.82 2.16 2.32 This particular row gives the term structure of interest rates in December 1946. Interest rates are given in annual percentage terms ; that is, 0.32 means 0.32% per year. Here are some pictures of term structures, taken from the file. 4 In the graphs below, each line represents the term structure in a particular month. In 1948 the term structures were very closely correlated, and all were upward sloping: 2. A paper by Gultekin and Rogalski (1984) seems to confirm this. 3. The data are from McCullogh (1990). For updated daily term structures on Treasuries, go to http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center . 4. The interest rates are pure discount rates, calculated so that the value of a bond with price P and with N payments, C 1 , C 2 , … , C N is PC rt tt tN = +()=∑1 1 . The column marked “0mo” gives the instantaneous interest rate —the shortest-term interest rate in the market. You can think of this as the rate paid by a money market fund on a 1-day deposit. 535 Duration Contrast this with the term structures in 1981: Here there were upward- and downward-sloping term structures, as well as term structures with “humps”: 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 2.4 2.6 Pure discount rate % MaturityTerm Structures, 1948 Term Structures, 1981 891011121314151617 0mo 1mo 2mo 3mo 4mo5mo 6mo 9mo 1yr 2 yr 3yr4yr5yr 10yr 15yr 20yr25yrmaturitypure discount rate, % Despite this great variety of term structure shapes, you will see in exercise 7 to this chapter that the Macaulay duration can give an adequate approximation to the change in bond value over short periods. 536 Chapter 20 20.7 Summary In this chapter we have summarized the basics of duration, a commonly used risk measure for bonds. The duration measure was originally developed by Macaulay (1938) to measure the time-weighted average of a bond ’ s payments. It can also represent the bond ’ s price elasticity to a change in its discount rate. This chapter has explored duration computation basics; in the next chapter we use duration to describe the immunization of a bond portfolio. Exercises 1. In the spreadsheet below, create a Data Table in which the duration is computed as a function of the coupon rate (coupon = 0%, 1%, … , 11%). Comment on the relation between the coupon rate and the duration. 1 2 3 45 6 78 9C B A Current date 21-May-07 Maturity, in years 21 Maturity date 21-May-27 % 5 1 M T Y Coupon 4% Face value 1,000 Duration 9.03982 <-- =DURATION(B2,B4,B6,B5,1)CHANGING THE COUPON RATE Effect on Duration 2. What is the effect on a bond ’ s duration of increasing the bond ’ s maturity? As in the previ- ous example, use a numerical example and plot the answer. Note that as N → ∞ , the bond becomes a consol (a bond that has no repayment of principal but an infinite stream of coupon payments). The duration of a consol is given by (1 + YTM ) / YTM . Show that your numerical answers converge to this formula. 3. “Duration can be viewed as a proxy for the riskiness of a bond. All other things being equal, the riskier of two bonds should have lower duration.” Check this claim with an example. What is its economic logic? 4. A pure discount bond with maturity N is a bond with no payments at times t = 1, … , N − 1; at time t = N , a pure discount bond has a single terminal payment of both principal and interest. What is the duration of such a bond? 537 Duration 5. Replicate the two graphs in section 20.5. 6. On 23 January 1987, the market price of a West Jefferson Development Bond was $1,122.32. The bond pays $59 in interest on 1 March and 1 September of each of the years 1987–1993. On 1 September 1993, the bond is redeemed at its face value of $1,000. Calculate the yield to maturity of the bond and then calculate its duration. 7. Rewrite the formula DDuration in section 20.5, so that if the timeToFirstPayment α is not inserted, then α automatically defaults to 1. 2 1 Immunization Strategies 21.1 Overview A bond portfolio ’ s value in the future depends on the interest-rate structure prevailing up to and including the date at which the portfolio is liquidated. If a portfolio has the same payoff at some specific future date, no matter what interest-rate structure prevails, then it is said to be immunized . This chapter discusses immunization strategies, which are closely related to the conception of duration discussed in Chapter 20. Immunization strategies have been dis-cussed for many concepts of duration, but this chapter is restricted to the simplest duration concept, that of Macaulay. 21.2 A Basic Simple Model of Immunization Consider the following situation: A firm has a known future obligation, Q (a good example would be an insurance firm, which knows that it has to make a payment in the future). The discounted value of this obligation is VQ rN 01= +() where r is the appropriate discount rate. Suppose that this future obligation is hedged by a bond held by the firm. By this we mean that the firm currently holds a bond, whose value V B is equal to the discounted value of the future obligation, V 0 . If P 1 , P 2 , … P M is the stream of anticipated payments made by the bond, then the bond ’ s present value is given by VP rBt t tM = +()=∑1 1 Now suppose that the underlying interest rate, r , changes to r + Δ r . Using a first-order linear approximation, we find that the new value of the future obli-gation is given by VV VdV drrV rNQ rN 00 00 0 11+≈ + = +− +()⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥ +ΔΔ Δ However, the new value of the bond is given by 540 Chapter 21 VV VdV drrV rtP rBB BB Bt t tN +≈ + = +− +()+ =∑ ΔΔ Δ 11 1 If these two expressions are equal, a change in r will not affect the hedging properties of the company ’ s portfolio. Setting the expressions equal gives us the condition VrtP rVrNQ rBt t tN N+− +()=+− +()⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥ + =+ ∑ΔΔ 111 10 1 Recalling that VVQ rB N== +()01 we can simplify this expression to get 1 1 1 VtP rN Bt t tM +()= =∑ The last equation is worth restating as a formal proposition: Suppose that the term structure of interest rates is always flat (that is, the discount rate for a cash flow occurring at all future times is the same) or that the term structure moves up or down in parallel movements. Then a necessary and sufficient condition that the market value of an asset be equal under all changes of the discount rate r to the market value of a future obligation Q is that the duration of the asset equal the duration of the obligation. Here we understand the word “equal” to mean equal in the sense of a first-order approximation. An obligation against which an asset of this type is held is said to be immunized . The above statement has two critical limitations: • The immunization discussed applies only to first-order approximations. When we get to a numerical example in the succeeding sections, we shall see that there is a big difference between first-order equality and “true” equality. In Animal Farm , George Orwell made the same observation about the barn- yard: “All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.” • We have assumed either that the term structure is flat or that the term struc- ture moves up or down in parallel movements. At best, this might be consid-ered to be a poor approximation of reality (recall the term structure graphs in 541 Immunization Strategies section 20.5). Alternative theories of the term structure lead to alternative definitions of duration and immunization (for alternatives, see Bierwag et al., 1981, 1983a, 1983b; Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross, 1985; Vasicek, 1977). In an empirical investigation of these alternatives, Gultekin and Rogalski (1984) found that the simple Macaulay duration we use in this chapter works at least as well as any of the alternatives. 21.3 A Numerical Example In this section we consider a basic numerical immunization example. Suppose you are trying to immunize a year-10 obligation whose present value is $1,000 (this means that, at the current interest rate of 6%, its future value is $1,000 · (1.06) 10 = $1,790.85. You intend to immunize the obligation by pur- chasing $1,000 worth of a bond or a combination of bonds. You consider three bonds: • Bond 1 has 10 years remaining until maturity, a coupon rate of 6.7%, and a face value of $1,000. • Bond 2 has 15 years until maturity, a coupon rate of 6.988%, and a face value of $1,000. • Bond 3 has 30 years until maturity, a coupon rate of 5.9%, and a face value of $1,000. At the existing yield to maturity of 6%, the prices of the bonds differ. Bond 1, for example, is worth $, . ., .1 051 5267 10 61 000 10 610 10=()+()∑ t t ; thus, in order to purchase $1,000 worth of this bond, you have to purchase $951 = $1,000/$1,051.52 of face value of the bond. Bond 3, however, is currently worth $986.24, so that in order to buy $1,000 of market value of this bond, you will have to buy $1,013.96 of face value of the bond. If you intend to use this bond to finance a $1,790.85 obligation 10 years from now, here ’ s a schematic of the problem you face: 542 Chapter 21 As we will see below, the 30-year bond will exactly finance the future obligation of $1,790.85 only for the case in which the current market interest rate of 6% remains unchanged. Here is a summary of price and duration information for the three bonds: When the interest rate increases: When the interest rate decreases:THE IMMUNIZATION PROBLEM Illustrated here for the 30-year bond. 0 Year 10: Future obligation of $1,790.85 due. 30 Buy $1,014 face value of 30-year bond.Reinvest coupons from bond during years 1-10.Sell bond for PV of remaining coupons and redemption in year 30.

Now suppose that immediately after you purchase the bonds the yield to maturity changes to some new value and stays there. This will obviously affect the calculation we did above. For example, if the yield falls to 5%, the table will now look as follows: 544 Chapter 21 Thus, if the yield falls, bond 1 will no longer fund our obligation, whereas bond 3 will overfund it. Bond 2 ’ s ability to fund the obligation—not surpris- ingly, in view of the fact that its duration is exactly 10 years—hardly changes. We can repeat this calculation for any new yield to maturity.

This means that there is another way to get a bond investment with a duration of 10: If we invest $665.09 in bond 1 and $344.91 in bond 3, the resulting portfolio also has a duration of 10.

Redington (1952), one of the influential propagators of the concept of duration and immunization, thought this convexity very desirable, and we can see why: No matter what the change in the yield to maturity, the portfolio of bonds provides more overfunding of the future obligation than the single bond. This is obviously a desirable property for an immunized portfolio, and it leads us to formulate the following rule: In a comparison between two immunized portfolios, both of which are to fund a known future obligation, the portfolio whose terminal value is more convex with respect to changes in the yield to maturity is preferable. 1 1. There is another interpretation of the convexity shown in this example: It shows the impossibil- ity of parallel changes in the term structure! If such changes describe the uncertainty relating to the term structure, a bond position can be chosen which always benefits from changes in the term structure. This is an arbitrage, and therefore impossible. I thank Zvi Wiener for pointing this out to me. 547 Immunization Strategies 21.5 Building a Better Mousetrap Despite what was said in the preceding section, there is some interest in deriv- ing the characteristics of a bond portfolio whose terminal value is as insensitive to changes in the yield as possible. One way of improving the performance (when so defined) of the bond portfolio is not only to match the first deriva-tives of the change in value (which, as we saw in section 20.3, leads to the duration concept), but also to match the second derivatives. A direct extension of the analysis of section 20.3 leads us to the conclusion that matching the second derivatives requires: NNVtt P r Bt t tM +() =+() +() =∑ 111 1 1 The following example illustrates the kind of improvement that can be made in a portfolio where the second derivatives are also matched. Consider 4 bonds, one of which, bond 2, is our old friend from the previous example, whose duration is exactly 10.

The proportions of a portfolio which sets both the duration and its second derivative equal to those of the liability are bond 1 = − 0.5619, bond 3 = 1.6415, bond 4 = − 0.0797. 2 As the following figure shows, this portfolio provides a better hedge against the terminal value than even bond 2: 2. See next subsection for the details of this computation. Here secondDur(numberPayments, couponRate, YTM) is a VBA function we have defined to calculate the second derivative of the duration: 549 Immunization Strategies Computing the Bond Portfolio We want to invest proportions x 1 , x 3 , x 4 in bonds 1, 3, and 4 so that: • The portfolio is totally invested: x 1 + x 3 + x 4 = 1. • The portfolio duration is matched to that of bond 2: x 1 D 1 + x 3 D 3 + x 4 D 4 = D 2 , where D i is the duration of bond i . • The second derivative of the portfolio duration is matched to that of bond 2: xD xD xD D112 332 442 22++= , where Di2 is the duration derivative.

Immunization involves setting the bond portfolio ’ s duration equal to the duration of the underlying liability against which the portfolio is held. This chapter shows how to effect the immunization of the portfolio. Needless to say, Excel is an excellent tool for immunization calculations. Exercises 1. Prove that the duration of a portfolio is the weighted average duration of the portfolio assets. 2. Set up a spreadsheet that enables you to duplicate the calculations of section 21.5 of this chapter. 3. Using the example of section 21.5, find a combination of bonds 1 and 3 with a duration of 8. Then find a combination of bonds 1 and 2 with a duration of 8. 4. In exercise 3, which portfolio would you prefer to immunize an obligation with a duration of 8? 5. In exercise 3, recalculate the portfolio proportions assuming that you need a target duration of 12. Which portfolio would you prefer now? 2 2 Modeling the Term Structure * 22.1 Overview This chapter discusses the problem of fitting an equation to the term structure of interest rate. The main problem looks like this: We are given a set of bond prices. Can we say something intelligent about the yields on these bonds, for example, in terms of time to maturity or in terms of yields versus duration? The problem is surprisingly complicated. It is obvious that we need to take into account the riskiness of the bonds (the set of bonds should be of equal risk) and their time pattern of interest payments. There is an additional com-plicating factor: The most common interest rate measure for bonds is the yield to maturity (YTM), essentially the internal rate of return of the bond price and the future promised payments on the bond. For analytical purposes, however, it is more meaningful to attach a discount factor d t to payments made in each time period. These discount factors define the so-called pure discount yields on the bonds. 1 This chapter starts with the simplest term structure problem, where there is only one bond for each time period. We then go on to discuss more compli-cated situations. The functional form we fit to the term structure is the Nelson-Siegel model (1987). We also show a variation of this model due to Svensson (section 22.8). 22.2 Basic Example In this section we introduce two methods of pricing bonds in the case where each bond maturity is associated with a single bond. 2 The two methods are • Computing the yield to maturity of each bond. Each bond ’ s yield to maturity (YTM) is the internal rate of return of the bond price and the future payments. * This chapter was co-authored by Dr. Alexander Suhov of Tel Aviv University, a.y.suhov@gmail .com. 1. Those familiar with the Treasury bond strip market will recognize the factors d t as the discount factors associated with Treasury strips. See www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/marketables/strips/ strips.htm. 2. In the next section we discuss the case where there are multiple bonds for the same maturity with possibly inconsistent pricing. 554 Chapter 22 • Computing a set of unique, time-dependent, discount factors for the bonds. Labeling the discount factor for time t by d t , a bond ’ s price is computed by Price C d tt tN = =∑ 1 , where C t is the promised bond payment at time t . To illustrate these two methods, consider 15 bonds, each of which pays an annual coupon until maturity and each of which has a face value of 100. The bonds have a maturity of 1, 2, …, 15.

Suppose that each time period t has its own discount factor d t .

Consider, for example, a 5-period bond with a coupon of 3%. The price of this bond, using the current term structure, is 85.5549: 557 Modeling the Term Structure From Discount Factors to a Term Structure The discount factors determine a zero-coupon term structure : dy ttt=− ∗ () exp , where y t is the continuously compounded pure-discount rate for time t . Solving the discount factors for the zero-coupon interest rate gives yd ttt=()ln This means that we can write our bond pricing equation in terms of discount rates instead of discount factors: Price C d C e tt tN tyt tN t== =− =∑∑ 11 Applying this to our example: 21 22 23GH I J KLM Time --> 0 1 2 3 4 5 New bond 85.5549 3 3 3 3 103 <-- {=MMULT(I22:W22,F3:F17)} 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 1011 12 13 1415 16 17 18 19FG H I JKLMNOP Discount factors d tInterest rate y tTime--> Bond 012345 0.9471 5.44% <-- =-LN(F3)/C3 1 -96.60 102.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.8911 5.76% <-- =-LN(F4)/C4 2 -93.71 2.50 102.50 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.8354 6.00% <-- =-LN(F5)/C5 3 -91.56 3.00 3.00 103.00 0.00 0.00 0.7815 6.16% <-- =-LN(F6)/C6 4 -90.24 3.50 3.50 3.50 103.50 0.00 0 0 . 4 0 1 0 0 . 4 0 0 . 4 0 0 . 4 0 0 . 4 4 7 . 9 8 - 5 % 9 2 . 6 0 0 3 7 . 0 0 5 . 4 0 5 . 4 0 5 . 4 0 5 . 4 0 5 . 4 4 0 . 0 9 - 6 % 9 3 . 6 4 1 8 6 . 0 0 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 0 0 . 5 9 0 . 1 9 - 7 % 7 4 . 6 8 5 3 6 . 0 0 5 . 5 0 5 . 5 0 5 . 5 0 5 . 5 0 5 . 5 2 8 . 2 9 - 8 % 3 5 . 6 0 3 9 5 . 0 0 0 . 6 0 0 . 6 0 0 . 6 0 0 . 6 0 0 . 6 9 1 . 5 9 - 9 % 8 5 . 6 0 3 5 5 . 0 0 5 . 6 0 5 . 6 0 5 . 6 0 5 . 6 0 5 . 6 4 1 . 8 9 - 0 1 % 2 6 . 6 7 5 1 5 . 0 0 0 . 7 0 0 . 7 0 0 . 7 0 0 . 7 0 0 . 7 0 6 . 1 0 1 - 1 1 % 6 6 . 6 9 0 8 4 . 0 0 5 . 7 0 5 . 7 0 5 . 7 0 5 . 7 0 5 . 7 4 5 . 5 0 1 - 2 1 % 8 6 . 6 4 8 4 4 . 0 0 0 . 8 0 0 . 8 0 0 . 8 0 0 . 8 0 0 . 8 0 9 . 9 0 1 - 3 1 % 1 7 . 6 1 8 1 4 . 0 0 5 . 8 0 5 . 8 0 5 . 8 0 5 . 8 0 5 . 8 4 6 . 4 1 1 - 4 1 % 3 7 . 6 8 9 8 3 . 0 0 0 . 9 0 0 . 9 0 0 . 9 0 0 . 9 0 0 . 9 3 7 . 9 1 1 - 5 1 % 5 7 . 6 5 3 6 3 . 0 {=MMULT(MINVERSE(L3:Z17),-K3:K17)}5.0%5.2%5.4%5.6%5.8%6.0%6.2%6.4%6.6%6.8%7.0% 0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5Pure Discount Term Structure 558 Chapter 22 Different prices or coupons for bonds can produce quite intricate term structures.

In real data situations, there are often a number of bonds with similar maturities and possibly inconsistent pricing. In bond markets, which are typified by thin trading and often-misreported prices, this is a common occurrence. Suppose, as in the next example, we have several bonds with similar maturities. In the example below there are two bonds for 3-, 6-, and 9-year maturities, each with a slightly different YTM. 559 Modeling the Term Structure The matrix of cash flows is no longer square, since there are now 15 bonds with 12 maturities. In section 22.2 we found the discount factors d t by inverting the matrix of payments, but in this case this matrix is not invertible, since it is not square: 1 2 34 5 6789 10111213 14 15161718 19ABCDEF Bond Price MaturityAnnual coupon rate YTM 1 91.8967 1 2.0% 10.99% 2 83.2564 2 2.5% 12.47% 3 76.0000 3 3.0% 13.20% 4 76.2347 3 3.2% 13.32% 5 71.2110 4 3.5% 13.22% 6 67.9672 5 4.0% 13.14% 7 66.0000 6 4.5% 13.01% 8 66.1625 6 4.2% 12.56% 9 65.4881 7 5.0% 12.74% 10 65.7003 8 5.5% 12.53% 11 64.0000 9 5.8% 12.75% 12 66.6158 9 6.0% 12.35% 13 68.0989 10 6.5% 12.19% 14 70.0480 12 7.0% 11.79% 15 72.3857 15 7.5% 11.43%MULTIPLE BONDS WITH SAME MATURITY =IRR(H17:W17) 2 3456789 1011121314151617FGH I JKLMNOPQRST YTMTime--> Bond ↓0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 0 . 9 9 %1 - 9 1 . 9 0 1 0 2 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 012.47% 2 -83.26 2.50 102.50 0.00 0.00 0 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 0 1 3 . 2 0 %3 - 7 6 . 0 03 . 0 03 . 0 0 1 0 3 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 01 3 . 3 2 %4 - 7 6 . 2 33 . 2 03 . 2 0 1 0 3 . 2 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 013.22% 5 -71.21 3.50 3.50 3.50 103.50 0. 00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 13.14% 6 -67.97 4.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 104. 00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 1 3 . 0 1 %7 - 6 6 . 0 04 . 5 04 . 5 04 . 5 04 . 5 04 . 5 0 1 0 4 . 5 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 01 2 . 5 6 %8 - 6 6 . 1 64 . 2 04 . 2 04 . 2 04 . 2 04 . 2 0 1 0 4 . 2 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 01 2 . 7 4 %9 - 6 5 . 4 95 . 0 05 . 0 05 . 0 05 . 0 05 . 0 05 . 0 0 1 0 5 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 00 . 0 012.53% 10 -65.70 5.50 5.50 5.50 5.50 5. 50 5.50 5.50 105.50 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 12.75% 11 -64.00 5.80 5.80 5.80 5.80 5. 80 5.80 5.80 5.80 105.80 0.00 0.00 0.00 12.35% 12 -66.62 6.00 6.00 6.00 6.00 6. 00 6.00 6.00 6.00 106.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 12.19% 13 -68.10 6.50 6.50 6.50 6.50 6. 50 6.50 6.50 6.50 6.50 106.50 0.00 0.00 12.06% 14 -70.05 7.00 7.00 7.00 7.00 7. 00 7.00 7.00 7.00 7.00 7.00 107.00 0.00 11.95% 15 -72.39 7.50 7.50 7.50 7.50 7. 50 7.50 7.50 7.50 7.50 7.50 7.50 107.50 We can find the discount factors by using a least squares approximation: For each maturity t , we find a factor d t so that the square of the pricing errors for the set of bonds is minimized. The least squares approximation is usually employed to determine the approximate solution of overdetermined systems, 560 Chapter 22 that is, sets of equations in which the equations outnumber the unknowns. “Least squares” means that the overall solution minimizes the sum of the squares of the errors made in the results of every equation. We want to solve for a vector of discount factors d that best approximates the pricing of the bonds.

We may, however, want to fit a functional form to the term structure. The advantage of a functional form is that it allows us to interpolate interest rates for time periods and coupons that are not in our data set. It also allows us to determine the sensitivity of the term structure to structural factors. One popular fitted form for the term structure is the Nelson-Siegel (NS) term structure, which postulates that 563 Modeling the Term Structure yte te tett t()=+−⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟+−⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟−⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ −− −αα β α βββ β 12 311 This model can also be written as: yte tet t()=+ + ()−⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟− − −αα α β αβ β 12 3 31 In the next section we analyze the NS term structure model and discuss the meaning and the plausible values of its parameters ( α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , β ).

In the example above we label these d LS ( t ) and y LS ( t ). Step 2: We now assume arbitrary but reasonable values for α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , and β . In the next section we discuss what these values might be.

In this section we examine the NS to explain what these values might be. 567 Modeling the Term Structure The NS zero coupon yield is yte te tett t()=+−⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟+−⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟−⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ −− −αα β α βββ β 12 311 ==+ + ()−⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟⎛⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟− − −αα α β αβ β 12 3 31e tet t NS Property 1: The Shortest-Term Rate y (0) Setting t = 0 gives y (0) = α 1 + α 2 . This is the NS shortest-term rate. It follows that for most term structures α 1 + α 2 > 0. NS Property 2: The Longest-Term Rate y ( ∞ ) Setting t = ∞ gives y ( ∞ ) = α 1 . This is the asymptotic long-term interest rate in the NS model. NS Property 3: β Controls the Location of the Term Structure Hump The NS term structure is defined only if β > 0. If the term structure has a “hump,” this can be controlled by the β . In the graph below, we illustrate this. Large betas (e.g., β = 12, below) produce upward-sloping term structures, whereas lower β ’ s produce humpy term structures. Increasing the beta pushes the hump out. Roughly speaking, β is the location of the hump. 0.00%1.00%2.00%3.00%4.00%5.00%6.00% 02468 1 0 1 2 1 4Eﬀect of bon NS Term Structure beta = 0.3 beta = 0.7 beta = 1.0 beta = 1.3 beta = 4.0 beta = 12.0 568 Chapter 22 NS Property 4: α 3 Affects the Hump The factor α 3 has no influence at either very short or very long yields and contributes to the term structure at medium-term yields only. Very roughly speaking, α 3 > 0 produces a concave term structure, α 3 < 0 produces a convex term structure, and α 3 = 0 produces a flat term structure: -15.00%-10.00%-5.00%0.00%5.00%10.00%15.00%20.00%25.00%30.00% 02468 1 0 1 2 1 4Nelson-Siegel Term Structure for Diﬀerent Alpha3 Beta = 1.5 alpha3=-0.4 alpha3=0.0 alpha3=0.8 Nelson-Siegel: Summing Up Fitting a term structure to the NS model involves setting initial values for ( α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , β ). Plausible initial values can be set by “eyeballing” the empirical term structure and setting: • α 1 + α 2 = approximate zero-term interest rate. • α 1 = approximate long-term rate. • β = approximate location of the hump. • α 3 affects the concavity/convexity of the term structure. 569 Modeling the Term Structure 22.6 Term Structure for Treasury Notes In this section we fit the Nelson-Siegel (NS) model to the prices of Treasury notes.

In U.S. markets the actual price paid by the purchaser of the bond, the so-called invoice price, is the sum of the clean price plus the relative portion of the current coupon payment. 4 This latter term, the “accrued interest,” is computed by: Accrued interestCurrent date Last interest date Next interest da=− tte Last interest datePeriodic int erest−∗ 4. In most European bond markets, the quoted bond price is the actual price paid for the bond and there is no separate accrued interest calculation. 570 Chapter 22 The Excel file computes the accrued interest using the formulas Coupdaybs and Coupdays .

The result is: 571 Modeling the Term Structure 22.7 An Additional Computational Improvement In this section we present another method of computing the Nelson-Siegel term structure. The method has the advantages of better convergence for short-term securities. In addition the method in the previous section optimizes four nonlinear parameters, whereas the method in this section optimizes three linear parameters and one nonlinear parameter; this minimizes the problem of non-uniqueness of the parameters. Here are the steps in this method: • We compute the discount factors using the NS method as illustrated in section 22.6. • We use these discount factors to discount the bond ’ s payments, but not the final return of face value. • We compute a rate r T for each bond ’ s face value so that the model price of the bond (using the combination of the NS discount factors and r T ) equals the bond ’ s invoice price. • We now optimize Nelson-Siegel to minimize the differences between the r T and the corresponding Nelson-Siegel rate.

The Nelson-Siegel approximation was introduced in detail and its applications were discussed, along with (in section 22.8) the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson variation. We began with the simplest case, in which there is only one bond for each maturity, so that the term structure can be found uniquely. Next, we extended the method to a set in which several bonds can have the same maturity. Then, we discussed a real-life case of Treasury notes, which can have any maturity date. Finally, the Svensson exten-sion of the NS methods was presented. 575 Modeling the Term Structure Function NSrate(alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, beta, t) If t = 0 Then NSrate = alpha1 + alpha2 Else NSrate = alpha1 + (alpha2 + alpha3) * _ (beta / t) * (1 - Exp(-t / beta)) - _ alpha3 * Exp(-t / beta) End If End Function The function NSdiscount computes the NS discount factors: Function NSdiscount(alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, _ beta, t) If t = 0 Then NSdiscount = 1 Else NSdiscount = Exp(-t * (alpha1 + _ (alpha2 + alpha3) * (beta / t) * _ (1 - Exp(-t / beta)) - alpha3 * _ Exp(-t / beta))) End If End Function Appendix: VBA Functions Used in This Chapter The function NSrate computes the Nelson-Siegel rate for time t based on specific values of the four NS parameters α 1 , α 2 , α 3 , β : 576 Chapter 22 Function NSprice(alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, _ beta, j, no_payments, rate, frequency) temp = 0 rrate = rate / frequency For i = 0 To no_payments - 1 temp = temp + rrate * 100 * _ NSdiscount(alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, beta, _ j + i / frequency) Next i NSprice = temp + 100 * NSdiscount(alpha1, _ alpha2, alpha3, beta, j + (no_payments - 1) _ / frequency) End Function The function NSImpliedRate uses Excel functions to compute the implied rates: The function NSprice computes the price of a standard coupon bond using the Nelson-Siegel term structure: 577 Modeling the Term Structure Private Function LS(XMatrix, YVector) Dim X, Y, A, B As Variant X = XMatrix Y = YVector n = UBound(X, 1) l = UBound(Y) If n < > l Then GoTo FEnd With WorksheetFunction A = .MMult(.Transpose(X), X) LS = .MMult(.MInverse(A), _ .MMult(.Transpose(X), Y)) End With FEnd: End Function 2 3 Calculating Default-Adjusted Expected Bond Returns 23.1 Overview In this chapter we discuss the effects of default risk on the returns from holding bonds to maturity. The expected return on a bond that may possibly default is different from the bond ’ s promised return . The latter is defined as the bond ’ s yield to maturity , the internal rate of return calculated from the bond ’ s current market price and its promised coupon payments and promised eventual return of principal in the future. The bond ’ s expected return is less easily calculated: We need to take into account both the bond ’ s probability of future default and the recovery rate , the percentage of its principal which holders can expect to recover in the case of default. To complicate matters still further, default can happen in stages, through the gradual degradation of the issuing company ’ s creditworthiness. 1 In this chapter we use a Markov model to solve for the expected return on a risky bond. Our adjustment procedure takes into account all three of the factors mentioned: the probability of default, the transition of the issuer from one state of creditworthiness to another, and the percentage recovery of face value when the bond defaults. In sections 23.2–23.4 we first use Excel to solve a relatively small-scale problem. We then use some publicly available statistics to program a fuller spreadsheet model. Finally, we show that this model can be used to derive bond betas, the CAPM ’ s risk measure for securities (dis-cussed previously in Chapters 8–11). Some Preliminaries Before proceeding, we define a number of terms: • A bond is issued with a given amount of principal or face value . When the bond matures, the bondholder is promised the return of this principal. If the bond is issued at par , then it is sold for the principal amount. • A bond bears an interest rate called the coupon rate . The periodic payment promised to the bondholders is the product of the coupon rate times the bond ’ s face value. 1. Besides default risk, bonds are also subject to term structure risk: The prices of bonds may show significant variations over time as a result of changing term structure. This statement will be especially true for long-term bonds. In this chapter we abstract from term structure risk, confin-ing ourselves only to a discussion of the effects of default risk on bond expected returns. 580 Chapter 23 • At any given moment, a bond will be sold in the market for a market price . This price may differ from the bond ’ s coupon rate. 2 • The bond ’ s yield to maturity (YTM) is the internal rate of return of the bond, assuming that it is held to maturity and that it does not default. American corporate bonds are rated by various agencies on the basis of the bond issuer ’ s ability to make repayment on the bonds. The classification scheme for two of the major rating agencies, Standard & Poor ’ s (S&P) and Moody ’ s, is given below: Long-Term Senior Debt Ratings Investment-Grade Ratings Speculative-Grade Ratings S&P Moody ’ s Interpretation S&P Moody ’ s Interpretation AAA Aaa Highest qualityBB + Ba1 Likely to fulfill obligations; ongoing uncertaintyBB Ba2 BB − Ba3 AA + Aa1 High quality B + B1 High-risk obligations AA Aa2 B B2AA − Aa3 B − B3 A + A1 Strong payment capacityCCC + Caa Current vulnerability to defaultA A2 CCC A − A3 CCC − BBB + Baa1 Adequate payment capacityC Ca In bankruptcy or default, or other marked shortcomingsBBB Baa2 D D BBB − Baa3 2. Just to complicate matters, in the United States the convention is to add to a bond ’ s listed price the prorated coupon (the accrued interest) between the time of the last coupon payment and the purchase date. The sum of these two is termed the invoice price of the bond; the invoice price is the actual cost at any moment to a purchaser of buying the bond. In our discussion in this chapter we use the term market price to denote the invoice price. The computation of the accrued interest is illustrated in section 23.5. 581 Calculating Default-Adjusted Expected Bond Returns When a bond defaults, its holders will typically receive some payoff, though less than the promised bond coupon rate and return of principal. We refer to the percentage of face value paid off in default as the recovery percentage . 3 23.2 Calculating the Expected Return in a One-Period Framework The bond ’ s yield to maturity is not its expected return: It is clear that both a bond ’ s rating and the anticipated payoff to bond holders in the case of bond default should affect its expected return. All other things being equal, we would expect that if two newly issued bonds have the same term to maturity, then the lower-rated bond (having the higher default probability) should have a higher coupon rate. Similarly, we would expect that an issued and traded bond whose rating has been lowered would experience a decrease in price. We might also expect that the lower the anticipated payoff in the case of default, the lower will be the bond ’ s expected return. As a simple illustration, we calculate the expected return of a one-year bond which can default at maturity. We use the following symbols: F = face value of the bond P = price of bond Q = annual coupon rate of the bond π = probability that the bond will not default at end of year λ = fraction of bond ’ s value bondholders collect upon default The bond ’ s expected end-of-year cash flow is π · (1 + Q ) · F + (1 − π ) · λ · F , and its expected return is given by One year bond exp ected returnExpected year end cash flow Initial--=bbond price P QF F P,− =⋅+() ⋅+−() ⋅⋅−1 111ππ λ 3. The bond ’ s recovery percentage is not, as you might think, the payoff to the bondholders in the final settlement of a bankruptcy. Instead it is usually computed as the price of the bond in the period immediately following a financial distress event. 582 Chapter 23 This calculation is illustrated in the following spreadsheet: 1 234 5 6789AB C 0 0 1 F , e u l a v e c a F 0 9 P , e c i r P Annual coupon rate, Q 8% Default probability 20% Recovery percentage 40% Expected period 1 cash flow 94.4 <-- =B2*(1+B4)*(1-B5)+B2*B6*B5Expected return 4.89% <-- =B8/B3-1EXPECTED RETURN ON A ONE-YEAR BOND WITH AN ADJUSTMENT FOR DEFAULT PROBABILITY 23.3 Calculating the Bond Expected Return in a Multi-Period Framework We now introduce multiple periods into the above problem. In this section we define a basic Markov model which uses a ratings transition matrix to compute a bond ’ s expected return. The model is illustrated using a very simple set of ratings, much simpler than the complex rating system illustrated in section 23.1. Section 23.5 uses more realistic data. We suppose that at any date there are four possible bond “ratings”: A, B, C Bond ratings of solvent bonds in decreasing order of credit worthiness. D The bond is in default for the first time and pays off recovery rate λ of the face value. E The bond was in default in the previous period; it therefore pays off 0 in the current period and in any future periods. The transition probability matrix Π is given by 583 Calculating Default-Adjusted Expected Bond Returns Π=⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎢ππππ ππππ ππππAA AB AC AD BA BB BC BD CA CB CC CD0 00 0000 10000 1⎢ ⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥ The probabilities in each row of the matrix Π indicate the probability that in one period the bond will go from a rating of i to a rating of j . In the numerical examples in this and the following two sections, we use the following Π : 2 34567ABC D E F A BC D E A 0.9700 0.0200 0.0100 0.0000 0.0000 B 0.0500 0.8000 0.1500 0.0000 0.0000 C 0.0100 0.0200 0.7500 0.2200 0.0000 D 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1.0000 E 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1.0000 What does this matrix Π mean? • If a bond is rated A in the current period, there is a probability of 0.97 that it will still be rated A in the next period. There is a probability 0.02 that it will be rated B in the next period and a probability of 0.01 that it will be rated C. It is impossible for the bond to be rated A today and D or E in the subsequent period. • A bond that starts off with a rating of B can—in a subsequent period—be rated A (with a probability of 0.05), be rated B (with a probability of 0.8), or be rated C (probability 0.15). Bonds rated B in the current period do not default (rating D) in the next period. The transition probabilities from state C to states A, B, C, and D are 0.01, 0.02, 0.75, and 0.22, respectively. • While it is possible to go from ratings A, B, or C to any of ratings A, B, C, or D, it is not possible to go from A, B, or C to E. This is so, since E denotes that default took place in the previous period . • A bond that is currently in state D (i.e., first-time default) will necessarily be in E in the next period. Thus the fourth row of our matrix Π will always be [0 0 0 0 1]. • Once the rating is in E, it remains there permanently. This means that the fifth row of the matrix Π will also always be [0 0 0 0 1]. 584 Chapter 23 The Multi-Period Transition Matrix The matrix Π defines the transition probabilities over one period. The two- period transition probabilities are given by the matrix product Π * Π . The spreadsheet below uses the array function MMULT . 4 It shows that the product Π * Π is: Two period transition probability -* 0.9420 0.0356 0.0202 0.00= =ΠΠ 2 22 0.0000 0.0900 0.6440 0.2330 0.0330 0.0000 0.0182 0.0312 0.5656 0. .1650 0.2200 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.000 00 0.0000 1.0000⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥ Thus if a bond is rated “B” today, there is a probability of 9% that in two periods it will be rated “A,” a probability of 64.4% that in two periods it will be rated B, a probability of 23.3% that in two periods it will be rated C, and a probability of 3.3% that in two periods it will default (and hence be rated D). Here is the spreadsheet: 4. See discussion of matrix products and array functions in Chapter 34. 585 Calculating Default-Adjusted Expected Bond Returns In general, the year t transition matrix is given by the matrix power Π t .

The Bond Payoff Vector Recall that Q denotes the bond ’ s coupon rate and λ denotes the recovery per- centage payoff of face value if the bond defaults. The payoff vector of the bond depends on whether the bond is currently in its last period N or whether t < N : Payoff t t NQ QQ Payoff t t NQQQ ,,< () =⎧ ⎨⎪ ⎪⎪ ⎩⎪ ⎪ ⎪=() =+ ++⎧ ⎨⎪ ⎪⎪ λλ 01 11 0⎩ ⎩⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 587 Calculating Default-Adjusted Expected Bond Returns The first three elements of each vector denote the payoff in non-defaulted states, the fourth element λ is the payoff if the rating is D, and the fifth element 0 is the payoff if the bond rating is E. (Recall that E is the rating for the period after the bond defaults—in our model the payoff in rating E is always zero.) The distinction between the two vectors depends, of course, on the repayment of principal in the terminal period. Before we can define the expected payoffs, we need to define one further vector, which will denote the initial state of the bond . This current state vector is a vector with a 1 for the current rating of the bond and zeros elsewhere. Thus, for example, if the bond has rating A at date 0, then initial = [1 0 0 0 0]; if it has date 0 rating of B, then initial = [0 1 0 0 0]. We can now define the expected bond payoff in period t : E Payoff t Initial Payoff t t() [] =⋅ ⋅ Π () 23.4 A Numerical Example We continue using the numerical Π from the previous section to price a bond with the following characteristics: • The bond is currently rated B. • Its coupon rate Q = 7%. • The bond has 5 more years to maturity. • The bond ’ s current market price is 100% of its face value. • The bond ’ s recovery percentage λ = 50%. The following spreadsheet shows the facts listed above as well as the payoff vectors of the bond at dates before maturity (in cells F3:F7) and on the maturity date (cells I3:I7). The transition matrix is given in cells C10:G14, and the initial vector is given in C16:G16. The expected bond payoffs are given in row 20. Before we explain how they were calculated, we note the important economic fact that—if the expected payoffs are as given—then the bond ’ s expected return is calculated by the Excel IRR function. As cell B21 shows, this expected return is 4.61%. The actual formula in cell B21 is IRR(B20:AN20) . This allows the calculation of the IRR of bonds of maturity up to 40 years. 588 Chapter 23 Note the use of the IF statement in translating the bond ’ s initial rating (cell B6) to the initial vector given in row 16. To avoid confusion, we write this as IF(Upper(B6) = “A”,1,0) , etc. This guarantees that even if the bond ’ s rating is entered as a lowercase letter, the initial vector will come out correctly. How to Calculate the Expected Bond Payoffs As indicated in the previous section, the period t expected bond payoff is given by the following formula: E [ payoff ( t )] = initial · Π t · payoff ( t ). The formula in row 21 uses two IF statements to implement this formula: = IF(year > bondterm, 0, IF(year = bondterm, MMULT(initial, MMULT(ma atrixpower (transition, year), payoff2)), MMULT(initial, MMULT ((matrixpower(transition, year), payoff1)))) Here ’ s what this means:1 2 34 5 6789 101112131415 16 17181920212223242526AB C D E F G H I Bond price 100.00% ) N ( f f o y a P ) N < t ( f f o y a P % 7 0 1 t h g i r o t s l l e C % 7 t h g i r o t s l l e C % 7 Q , e t a r n o p u o C Recovery rate, λ % 7 0 1 d e l l a c e r a % 7 d e l l a c e r a % 0 5 5 N , m r e t d n o B % 7 0 1 \" 2 f f o y a p \" % 7 \" 1 f f o y a p \" % 0 5 0 2 w o r n i % 0 5 0 2 w o r n i B g n i t a r l a i t i n I % 0 % 0 A BC D E Transition matrix → A 0.9700 0.0200 0.0100 0.0000 0.0000 B 0.0500 0.8000 0.1500 0.0000 0.0000 C 0.0100 0.0200 0.7500 0.2200 0.0000 D 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1.0000 E 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1.0000 Initial vecto r 01 0 00 Formula in cell C16: =IF(UPPER(B6)=\"A\",1,0) Y 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 r a e Expected payoffs -1.0000 0.0700 0.0842 0.0897 0.0899 0.8802 0.0000 0.0000 Expected yield 4.61% <-- =IRR(B20:AN20,0)CALCULATING THE EXPECTED BOND RETURN =IF(year>bondterm,0,IF(year=bondterm,MMULT(initial,MMULT(matrixpower(transition,year),payoff2)),MMULT(initial,MMULT(matrixpower(transition,year),payoff1))))IRR of expected payoffs 589 Calculating Default-Adjusted Expected Bond Returns • First IF : If the current year is greater than the bond term N (in our example N = 5 ), then the payoff on the bond is 0. • Second IF : If the current year is equal to the bond term N , then the expected payoff on the bond is MMULT(initial,MMULT(matrixpower(transition, year),payoff2)). Here transition is the name for the transition matrix in cells C10:G14 and payoff2 is the name for the cells I3:I7. • If the current year n is less than the bond term, then the expected payoff on the bond is MMULT(initial,MMULT(matrixpower(transition,C18), payoff1) , where payoff1 is the name for the cells F3:F7. Copying this formula gives the whole vector of expected bond payoffs. 23.5 Experimenting with the Example We can gain some insight into the relation between a bond ’ s expected return, its coupon rate, and its yield to maturity (YTM) by constructing some data tables. In the data table below we compute the bond ’ s expected return as a function of its recovery percentage λ : 28 29 303132333435 36 3738 39 404142 43 4445AB C D E F G H I Recovery percentage, l 4.61% <-- =B21 , Tableheader 0% 2.43% 7% 10% 2.87% 7% 20% 3.31% 7% 30% 3.74% 7% 40% 4.18% 7% 50% 4.61% 7% 60% 5.03% 7% 70% 5.46% 7% 80% 5.88% 7% 90% 6.30% 7% 100% 6.71% 7% Note: The data table has a series with the coupon rate appended so that in the graph we can see the convergence of the bond expectedreturn to the coupon rate (cells C30:C40)Data table: Recovery percentage and expected yield 0%1%2%3%4%5%6%7%8% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%Bond Expected Return and Recovery Rate Bond price = 100%, Bond Rating = B, Coupon = 7.00% 590 Chapter 23 We conclude that a bond selling at par will, for every recovery percentage λ , have expected return less than the coupon rate.

The accrued interest is jargon for the unpaid part of the bond coupon since the last interest payment. In U.S. bond markets, the accrued interest is added to the quoted bond price to compute the amount actually paid for the bond. In most European bond markets, the quoted bond price is the actual price paid for the bond and there is no separate accrued interest calculation. The accrued interest is defined as: Accrued interest =Current date Last interest date Next interest da− tte Last interest datePeriodic int erest−∗ • We use actual payment dates for the bond and use the XIRR function to compute the bond ’ s expected yield. • We use an actual transition matrix for bond ratings. The bond we analyze is a CCC-rated bond issued by AMR (the parent company of American Airlines). Originally issued on 15 May 1991 and matur- ing on 12 March 2021, the AMR bond has a coupon of 10.55% payable semiannually on 15 May and 15 November. When we looked up the bond on Yahoo on 20 July 2005, its price was 76.75% of par: 593 Calculating Default-Adjusted Expected Bond Returns To the quoted price of 76.75% we must add the bond ’ s accrued interest: 3 45678MN Accrued interest calculation Last payment date 15-Mar-05 Next payment date 15-Sep-05Current date 20-Jul-05 Percentage of period 0.69Accrued interest 0.0364 It follows that the actual price paid for the bond is 76.75% + 3.64% = 80.39%.

What Are the Recovery Rates? The recovery rate is obviously a critical factor in computing the bond ’ s expected return. There are considerable data on the recovery rates in bank-ruptcy from various industries. A table from an article by Edward Altman and Velore M. Kishore is given below; from this table we can see that the average recovery rate from a variety of industries was 41%.

Taking one standard deviation on either side of the average, we can conclude that the recovery percentage for a transportation company is somewhere between (38.42% – 27.98%, 38.42% + 27.98%) = ( ∼ 10%, ∼ 66%). In the spreadsheet below we have “backward engineered” a plausible set of recovery ratios, from 55% to 65%, for the AMR bond. These “guesstimates” for the AMR recovery is based on two assumptions: • The AMR bond should not have an expected return significantly more than the riskless rate of return, which at the time of our calculations was around 4%. • The AMR bond expected return should be significantly less than its YTM of ∼ 15%. The YTM is based on promised payments, and we find it implausible that these should correspond to the expected returns. This gives (highlighted area below) an expected bond yield of between 3.85% and 6.86% for the AMR bond: 40 41 42 434445 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54AB C D E F G H I Recovery percentage, λ YTM 0.0% -7.93% 14.78% 10.0% -6.22% 14.78% 20.0% -4.36% 14.78% 30.0% -2.32% 14.78% 40.0% -0.05% 14.78% 55.0% 3.85% 14.78% 60.0% 5.31% 14.78% 65.0% 6.86% 14.78% 80.0% 12.15% 14.78% 90.0% 16.27% 14.78% 100.0% 20.93% 14.78% Cell B41 contains the data table header =B33Data table: Recovery percentage and expected AMR bond return -10%-5%0%5%10%15%20%25% 0.0% 20.0% 40.0% 60.0% 80.0% 100.0% Recovery percentage l 596 Chapter 23 23.7 Semiannual Transition Matrices The analysis of the AMR bond in the previous section assumes that the annual transition probabilities are also valid for bonds paying semiannual coupons. We could refine this assumption by computing a semiannual transition matrix from the S&P data. Such a matrix would be the square root of the Π matrix.

The model presented in this chapter can be easily used to compute the beta of a bond. Recall from Chapter 2 that the capital asset pricing model ’ s security market line (SML) is given by: Er r Er r E r Expected return on debt rR e tdf d m f d f()=+ ()− [] ()= =β where uurn on riskless debt E r Return on equity market portfolio m()= If we know the expected return on debt, we can calculate the debt β , pro- vided we know the risk-free rate r f and the expected rate of return on the market E ( r m ). Suppose, for example, that the market risk premium E ( r m ) – r f = 8.4%, and that r f = 7%. Then a bond having an expected return of 8% will have a β of 0.119: Recovery percentage, lAnnual transition matrixSemiannual transition matrix 0% -3.05% 0.93% 10% -1.75% 2.14% 20% -0.30% 3.45% 30% 1.32% 4.86% 40% 3.15% 6.40% 55% 5.25% 8.07% 60% 7.68% 9.90% 65% 10.51% 11.89% 80% 13.83% 14.07% 90% 17.73% 16.45% 100% 22.33% 19.04%Expected bond returnCOMPARING THE EXPECTED RETURNS WITH SEMIANNUAL VS.

Computing a bond ’ s expected returns puts the bond analysis on the same footing as the analysis of stocks. Expected returns—common in the analysis of stocks—are rarely computed for bonds, where the common analysis is in terms of yields to maturity. But the yield to maturity of a bond, essentially the bond ’ s IRR based on its promised future payments, includes an ill-defined premium for the bond ’ s default. Having computed a bond ’ s expected return, we can then compute its beta using the security market line (SML). Compared to the vast efforts to compute and calibrate stock betas, relatively little research energy has been expended on bond betas. The technique illustrated in this chapter, based on the transition matrix of the bond ratings, is relatively new. This technique still has to be refined and thoroughly tested by academic research. Several refinements to the rating-based technique for computing expected bond returns still need to be explored. These include: 603 Calculating Default-Adjusted Expected Bond Returns • Better transition matrices . Transition matrices need to be refined, and perhaps made industry specific. (The problem with industry-specific data is that the number of observations drops dramatically. Nevertheless, there are examples of such data [for example, a Standard & Poor ’ s 2004 study on real estate–backed loans cited in the Selected References). • Time-dependent transition matrices . Our technique assumes that transition matrices are stationary—constant through time. Perhaps better techniques can be developed that allow for matrices to change with time. For example, we would expect that in difficult economic conditions, the ratings transition matrix would “shift to the right”—that the probabilities of a given rating getting worse over any period would increase. • More data on recovery ratios . Exercises 1. A newly issued bond with 1 year to maturity has a price of 100, which equals its face value. The coupon rate on the bond is 15%; the probability of default in 1 year is 35%; and the bond ’ s payoff in default will be 65% of its face value. a. Calculate the bond ’ s expected return. b. Create a data table showing the expected return as a function of the recovery percentage and the price of the bond. 2. Consider the case of five possible rating states, A, B, C, D, and E. A, B, and C are initial bond ratings, D symbolizes first-time default, and E indicates default in the previous period. Assume that the transition matrix Π is: Π=⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎢1000 0 0 06 0 90 0 03 0 01 0 0 02 0 05 0 88 0 05 0 0000 10000 1........ ⎢ ⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥ A 10-year bond issued today at par with an A rating is assumed to bear a coupon rate of 7%. • If a bond is issued today at par with a B rating and with a recovery percentage of 50%, what should be its coupon rate so that its expected return will also be 7%? • If a bond is issued today at par with a C rating and with a recovery percentage of 50%, what should be its coupon rate so that its expected return will be 7%? 3. Using the transition matrix of the previous problem: A C-rated bond is selling at par on 18 July 2007. The bond ’ s maturity is 17 July 2017, it has a coupon (paid annually on 17 July) of 11%, and it has a recovery percentage of λ = 67%. What is the bond ’ s expected return? 604 Chapter 23 4. An underwriter issues a new 7-year B-rated bond with a coupon rate 9%. If the expected rate of return on the bond is 8%, what is the bond ’ s implied recovery percentage λ ? Assume the transition matrix given in section 23.5. 5. An underwriter issues a new 7-year C-rated bond at par. The anticipated recovery rate in default of the bond is expected to be 55%. What should be the coupon rate on the bond so that its expected return is 9%? Assume the transition matrix of exercise 2. V MONTE CARLO METHODS Section V of Financial Modeling shows how to simulate financial problems in Excel. Traditional finance theory concentrates on the solution of financial problems: What is the optimal portfolio? What is the price of an option? Simu-lation is no substitution for solution of problems, but it often gives new insights into the nature of the uncertainty underlying the problem. In some cases—for example the path-dependent options discussed in Chapter 30—there is no concise pricing solution, and simulation methods are the best way to arrive at an acceptable price. Our aim in this section is to show the reader how to conceive of financial simulation and how to build simulations using Excel without additional add-ins. Chapter 24 is the basis of this discussion, showing how Excel ’ s random-number generator can be used to generate various distributions. We include in this chapter two methods for producing correlated random numbers. “Monte Carlo” refers to various simulation techniques that can be used to compute values of complicated functions that often have no analytical solution. Chapter 25 discusses the basics of Monte Carlo valuation. Its basic example shows how to compute the value of π using a simulation. Most financial pricing models assume that asset returns are lognormally distributed. In Chapter 26 we discuss this assumption and show how it can be simulated. Chapter 27 extends the simulations to discuss outcomes of investing in portfolios, and Chapter 28 discusses value at risk (VaR) in the context of simulation models. Finally Chapters 29 and 30 examine simulation methods as applied to options. In Chapter 29 we discuss the simulation of portfolio insurance, and in Chapter 30 we discuss Monte Carlo methods for pricing path-dependent options. 2 4 Generating and Using Random Numbers 24.1 Overview In this chapter we discuss techniques for computing random numbers. We use random numbers extensively in Chapters 25–30 to simulate stock prices, investment strategies, and option strategies. In this chapter we show how to produce both uniformly distributed and normally distributed random numbers. A random-number generator on a computer is a function that produces a seemingly unrelated set of numbers. The question of what is a random number is a philosophical one. 1 In this chapter we will ignore philosophy and con- centrate on some simple random-number generators—primarily the Excel random-number generator Rand( ) and the VBA random-number generator Rnd . 2 We will show how to use these generators to produce uniform random numbers and subsequently random numbers that are normally distributed. At the end of the chapter we use the Cholesky decomposition to produce corre-lated random numbers. To imagine a set of uniformly distributed random numbers think of an urn filled with 1,000 little balls, numbered 000, 001, 002, … , 999. Suppose we perform the following experiment: Having shaken the urn to mix up the balls, we draw one ball out of the urn and record the ball ’ s number. Next we put the ball back into the urn, shake the urn thoroughly so that the balls are mixed up again, and then draw out a new ball. The series of numbers produced by repeat-ing this procedure many times should be uniformly distributed between 000 and 999. A random-number generator on a computer is a function that imitates this procedure. The random-number generators considered in this chapter are sometimes termed pseudo-random-number generators , since they are actually deterministic functions whose values are indistinguishable from random numbers. All pseudo-random-number generators have cycles (i.e., they eventu-ally start to repeat themselves). The trick is to find a random-number generator 1. Philosophical? Perhaps theological. Knuth (1981, p. 142) gives the following quote: “A random sequence is a vague notion embodying the idea of a sequence in which each term is unpredictable to the uninitiated and whose digits pass a certain number of tests, traditional with statisticians and depending somewhat on the uses to which the sequence is to be put” (attributed to D. H. Lehmer, 1951). 2. In this book we usually write Excel functions in boldface without the parentheses. In this chapter we generally write Rand( ) with the parentheses to emphasize that (1) the parentheses are necessary, and (2) that they are empty. 608 Chapter 24 with a long cycle. The Excel Rand( ) function has very long cycles and is a respectable random-number generator. If you ’ ve never used a random-number generator, open an Excel spreadsheet and type = Rand( ) in any cell. You will see a 15-digit number between 0.000000000000000 and 0.999999999999999. Every time you recalculate the spreadsheet (e.g., by pressing the F9 key), the number changes. We leave the technical details of how Rand( ) works for the exercises to this chapter, where we show you how to design your own random-number generator. Suffice it to say, however, that the series of numbers produced by the function should be (to use Lehmer ’ s terminology from footnote 1) “unpredictable to the uninitiated.” In this chapter we shall deal with several kinds of random-number genera- tors: We first examine the uniform random-number generators which come with Excel and VBA. Subsequently we generate normally distributed random numbers. 3 Finally we generate correlated random numbers using the Cholesky decomposition. 24.2 Rand( ) and Rnd: The Excel and VBA Random-Number Generators Suppose you simply wanted to generate a list of random numbers. One way to do this would be to copy the Excel function Rand( ) to a range of cells. 1 2 3456789 1011 12ABCD E 0.6230 0.9983 0.2132 0.3381 <-- =RAND() 0.3836 0.7527 0.9139 0.36350.5948 0.7089 0.9563 0.13330.4543 0.7327 0.1095 0.97020.0250 0.1392 0.9793 0.50490.5001 0.3219 0.1293 0.22550.8931 0.4278 0.8038 0.22390.5847 0.9270 0.6634 0.54490.4985 0.2468 0.8391 0.5452 Each cell contains the function Rand( ) . Each time you update the spreadsheet or press F9 the block of cells will produce a new set of random numbers.USING EXCEL'S RAND( ) FUNCTION 3. A common nomenclature speaks of “random deviates.” Only in financial engineering can one find “normal deviates”! 609 Generating and Using Random Numbers In section 24.3 we will develop a crude test of how well Rand( ) works. Using VBA ’ s Rnd Function VBA contains its own function Rnd , which is equivalent to the Excel Rand function. 4 Here ’ s a small VBA program which illustrates a basic use of the Rnd function: Sub RandomList() ‘Produces a simple list of random numbers For Index = 1 To 10 Range(“A4”).Cells(Index, 1) = Rnd Next Index End Sub In the spreadsheet below, the VBA program has been assigned to a button, so that each time we click on the button, it runs a VBA program that produces 10 random numbers: 1 2 3456789 101112ABCDE List 0.045350.414030.862620.790480.373540.961950.871450.056240.949560.36402USING VBA'S RND FUNCTION TO PRODUCE A LIST OF RANDOM NUMBERS RandomList Macro 4. Confusing, no? Two different functions in the same computer package which do the same thing … 610 Chapter 24 Assigning a Macro to a Button or to a Control Sequence In the spreadsheet pictured on page 609, we have assigned the macro RandomList to the button marked “RandomList Macro.” Any drawing shape in Excel can be assigned a VBA program. In this case we have created a rectangle; right-clicking on this rectangle, we have assigned it a macro: 611 Generating and Using Random Numbers 24.3 Testing Random-Number Generators Producing lists of random numbers is interesting, though a bit uninformative. Is the list of numbers thus produced really uniformly distributed? A simple test is to generate each number and determine whether it falls into the interval [0,0.1), [0.1,0.2), … , [0.9,1). The notation [a,b) denotes the half-open interval between a and b ; a number x is in this interval if a ≤ x < b . If the list of numbers is really uniformly distributed, we would expect roughly an even number of the “random” numbers to be in each of the 10 intervals. One way to test this is to generate a list of random numbers on the spread- sheet by copying Rand( ) to many cells and then using the Excel array function Frequency(data_array,bins_array) . 5 This is illustrated in the following spreadsheet picture: 1 2 3456789 10111213 14F E D C B A Random numbers Bin Frequency 0.8978 <-- =RAND() 0.1 0 1 2 . 0 4 5 3 8 . 0 1 3 . 0 8 8 1 5 . 0 0 4 . 0 7 1 3 7 . 0 ) 2 1 D : 3 D , 2 1 A : 3 A ( Y C N E U Q E R F = - - < 0 5 . 0 7 6 0 5 . 0 4 6 . 0 8 1 4 2 . 0 1 7 . 0 6 0 4 6 . 0 1 8 . 0 8 2 2 1 . 0 2 9 . 0 1 1 6 5 . 0 0 1 3 4 5 5 . 0USING EXCEL'S FREQUENCY FUNCTION TO TEST THE DISTRIBUTION OF RAND() Each cell in the range A3:A12 contains the formula Rand() . Pressing F9 will produce a new set of random numbers and frequencies. 5. Array functions are explained in Chapter 34. 612 Chapter 24 This method is obviously not efficient (or even feasible) when we want to test the random-number generator for large numbers of random draws. The following program uses VBA to generate many random numbers and puts them into the bins in range A3:A12: 1 234 5 6789 10111213141516 17 18 19F E D C B A 0.724913 <-- =RAND() Bin Frequency 5 5 1 1 . 0 4 3 8 4 2 6 . 0 0 5 1 2 . 0 1 0 7 3 9 0 . 0 4 5 1 3 . 0 5 6 5 9 1 0 . 0 8 4 1 4 . 0 8 1 5 5 3 1 . 0 ) 2 1 D : 3 D , A : A ( Y C N E U Q E R F = - - < 5 5 1 5 . 0 4 4 5 8 4 2 . 0 2 4 1 6 . 0 3 4 8 5 9 1 . 0 9 5 1 7 . 0 5 7 9 2 3 5 . 0 8 4 1 8 . 0 9 5 0 1 3 2 . 0 9 3 1 9 . 0 7 4 7 5 9 4 . 0 5 4 1 1 2 7 5 6 1 0 . 0 0.526736 ) 2 1 E : 3 E ( M U S = - - < 5 9 4 1 l a t o T 9 1 7 1 1 2 . 0 0.214072 0.287068 0.877499 0.058629 0.154429USING EXCEL'S FREQUENCY FUNCTION TO TEST THE DISTRIBUTION OF RAND() Writing Frequency(A:A,D3:D12) refers to all non-empty cells in column A: 613 Generating and Using Random Numbers Sub UniformRandom() ‘Puts random numbers into bins Range(“E3”) = Time ’ the number of random draws N = Range(“B2”).Value Dim distribution(10) As Long ‘bins For k = 1 To N draw = Rnd distribution(Int(draw * 10) + 1) = _ distribution(Int(draw * 10) + 1) + 1 Next k For Index = 1 To 10 Range(“B5”).Cells(Index, 1) = distribution(Index) Next Index Range(“E4”) = Time End Sub 614 Chapter 24 In the spreadsheet below we have generated 100 million random numbers in 25 seconds: 1 2 3456789 1011 12 1314151617181920212223ABC D E F G H I J Runs 100,000,000 Starttime 8:55:57 Bin Output Stoptime 8:56:28 1 10,000,082 Elapsed 0:00:31 2 10,000,0793 9,999,875 4 9,999,979 5 10,000,2566 9,999,942 7 10,000,105 8 9,999,955 9 10,000,225 10 9,999,502UNIFORMLY-DISTRIBUTED RANDOM NUMBERS 9,999,0009,999,2009,999,4009,999,6009,999,80010,000,00010,000,20010,000,400 123456789 1 0Frequency Distribution of 100,000,000 Runs of VBA's Rnd FunctionUniformRandom Macro Here are some things to note about UniformRandom : • The program has a “clock” to measure the amount of time it takes to run. At the start of the program, we use Range(“E3”) = Time to put the current time into cell E3. At the end of the program, Range(“E4”) = Time puts in the ending time. The cell elapsed contains the formula = stoptime-starttime . Note that in order for the cells to read correctly, you have to use the command Format|Cells|Number|Time on the relevant cells. • The heart of the program uses the function Int(draw * 10) + 1 . Multiplying the random draw by 10 produces a number whose first digit is 0, 1, … , or 9. The VBA function Int gives this integer. Distribution is a VBA array numbered 1 to 10, with Distribution(1) being the number of random numbers in [0,0.1), Distribution(2) the number of random numbers in [0.1,0.2), etc. Thus Int(draw * 10) + 1 is the proper place in Distribution to which the current random draw belongs. 615 Generating and Using Random Numbers Using Randomize to Produce the Same List (or Not) of Random Numbers Most random-number generators use the last generated “random” number to produce the next. 6 The first number used in a particular sequence is controlled by the “seed,” which is typically taken from the computer ’ s clock. VBA ’ s Rnd is no exception, but it allows you to control the seed by using the command Randomize . The two small programs below illustrate two uses of this command. • Using Randomize without any numeric argument resets the seed (meaning— it breaks the connection between the next random number and the current random number). This is illustrated in the macro Random_EachDifferent , though it is difficult to see the effect. Sub Random_EachDifferent() ‘Produces a list of random numbers Randomize ‘Initializes the VBA random number generator For Index = 1 To 10 Range(“A5”).Cells(Index, 1) = Rnd() Next Index End Sub • Using Randomize(seed) uses a particular number as the seed. • Using the sequence of commands Rnd(negative number) and Randomize(seed) guarantees the same sequence of random numbers. This is illustrated in the macro Random_Same . 6. There are more examples of this in the exercises at the end of the chapter. 616 Chapter 24 Sub Random_Same() ‘Produces the same list of random numbers ‘which is always the same Rnd (-4) ‘Initializes the VBA random number generator Randomize (Range(“seed”)) For Index = 1 To 10 Range(“B5”).Cells(Index, 1) = Rnd() Next Index End Sub In the spreadsheet below, pushing the top button produces a random set of random numbers. Pushing the bottom button activates the macro Random_ Same and produces the same set of random numbers each time—provided the Seed (cell B2) isn ’ t changed. 1 2 3 4 56789 101112131415 16AB C Seed 334 Output: Each run differentOutput: Each run same 0.54165 0.29708 0.50241 0.706530.99067 0.654630.85176 0.968480.97838 0.489990.40634 0.723730.88656 0.065180.59110 0.600340.72938 0.253820.49635 0.70398 Note : to see the effect of the \"Run Random_Same\" button, erase the cells B5:B14.

In this section we explore four ways to produce normally distributed random numbers using Excel. Method 1: Normally Distributed Numbers Using Data|Data Analysis|Random Number Generation One way to do this is to use the Excel command Data|Data Analysis|Random Number Generation . Here ’ s how we get Excel to produce 1,000 random numbers which are normally distributed (with μ = 0 and σ = 1) in column A of the spreadsheet: 618 Chapter 24 If we want to see whether the output is distributed normally we can have Excel do a frequency distribution (either by using the array function Frequency or by using Data|Data Analysis|Histogram ). As the graph above shows, the output appears to be normally distributed. Method 2: Normally Distributed Numbers Using Norm.S.Inv(Rand( )) The Excel function Norm.S.Inv(Rand( )) can be used to generate normally distributed random numbers. To understand the use of this function, we start with an explanation of the function Norm.S.Dist . The Excel function Norm.S.Dist computes values of the standard normal distribution.

Given a number x between 0 and 1, Norm.S.Inv(x) produces number y such that Norm.S.Dist(y,1) = x .

We also use Norm.S.Dist(1,1) – Norm.S.Dist(1, − 1) to compute the percentage of the standard normal distribution that is between − 1 and + 1: 620 Chapter 24 Method 3: Incorporating Norm.S.Inv( ) into VBA The VBA program NormStandardRandom uses Norm.S.Inv to produce random deviates.

They look normally distributed: 621 Generating and Using Random Numbers The program NormStandardRandom includes two lines which measure the time taken for the whole simulation to run.

When, in NormStandardRandom2 , we classify the output into bins, we want these bins to be ( − ∞ , − 3.9], ( − 2.9, − 2.8], … , ( − 3.9, ∞ ). To do this we first define an array distribution( − 40 To 40) ; this array has 81 indices. To clas- sify a particular random number (say, X ) into the bins of this array, we use the function: 625 Generating and Using Random Numbers If X < -4 Then distribution(-40) = distribution(-40) + 1 ElseIf X > 4 Then distribution(40) = distribution(40) + 1 Else: distribution(Int(X / 0.1)) = _ distribution(Int(X / 0.1)) + 1 End If • NormStandardRandom2 produces not a histogram (which is a count of how many times a number falls into a particular bin), but a frequency distribu- tion . We do this by dividing by twice the number of runs (remember that each successful run produces two random numbers), 2 N , before we output the data to the spreadsheet: For Index = -40 To 40 Range(“output”).Cells(Index + 41, 1) = _ distribution(Index) / (2 * N) Next Index • Finally, note that the command Application.ScreenUpdating = False makes a big difference! This command prevents both the updating of the output in the cells and the Excel chart. Try running the program with and without this command to see the effect. Method 4: The Box-Muller Method The Box-Muller method for creating randomly distributed normal deviates is the fastest method of the four. 7 The eight lines which follow Start in the 7. See Box-Muller (1958) or Knuth (1981). 626 Chapter 24 VBA program below define a routine which in each successful iteration creates two numbers which are drawn from a standard normal distribution. The routine creates two random numbers, rand 1 and rand 2 , between − 1 and + 1.

Whereas Norm.S.Inv(rand( )) generates only standard normal devi- ates, we can use Norm.Inv to change the mean and standard deviation of our deviates. In Chapter 26, we will sometimes use this function to generate nor- mally distributed stock returns. 629 Generating and Using Random Numbers Norm.Inv as Alternative to Norm.S.Inv Norm.S.Inv(Rand( )) inverts the standard normal distribution and can be used to create standard normal deviates. The Excel function Norm.Inv(Rand ( )),mean,sigma) can be used to create normal deviates that are normally distributed with any normal distribution. The example below illustrates this: 1 23456789 1011121314151617181920212223AB C D EF G H I J Mean 2 Sigma 3 Norm.Inv(rand(),mean,sigma) Bin Frequency -0.0771 -10.0 0 <-- {=FR EQUENCY(A:A,D6:D46)} -3.1876 -9.4 0 0.7521 -8.8 0 2.0116 -8.2 0 1.8121 -7.6 0 2.5113 -7.0 0 8.1300 -6.4 1 2.6463 -5.8 1 5.2369 -5.2 4 4.8960 -4.6 4 2.3377 -4.0 14 4.4869 -3.4 9 3.3379 -2.8 10 0.4816 -2.2 20 2.9400 -1.6 44 -2.4114 -1.0 45 3.3061 -0.4 42 1.3751 0.2 61NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED RANDOM NUMBERS USING NORM.INV(rand(),mean,sigma ) <-- =NORM.INV(RAND(),$B$2,$B$3) 0102030405060708090100-10.0-8.8-7.6-6.4-5.2-4.0-2.8-1.6-0.40.82.03.24.45.66.88.09.210.411.612.814.01,000 normal deviates created with norm.inv(rand(),mean,sigma) 1 2 3456789 1011121314151617181920212223AB C D E F GH I JKLM Mean 3.00 Sigma 5.00 Bin Frequency Norm.Inv -12.00 1 <-- =FREQUENCY(A6:A1005,E5:E45) 1.1512 <-- =NORM.INV(RAND(),$B$2,$B$3) -11.25 1 -1.7767 <-- =NORM.INV(RAND(),$B$2,$B$3) -10.50 3 8.8680 <-- =NORM.INV(RAND(),$B$2,$B$3) -9.75 3 6.9032 -9.00 4 4.4525 -8.25 1 5.2241 -7.50 4 -1.9517 -6.75 11 -2.7898 -6.00 7 1.6515 -5.25 14 -0.4800 -4.50 11 3.5602 -3.75 19 10.7653 -3.00 21 1.6006 -2.25 32 2.0960 -1.50 58 8.3773 -0.75 43 2.5934 0.00 34 5.7685 0.75 51 1.3261 1.50 67CREATING NORMAL DEVIATES WITH NORM.INV(RAND()) 01020304050607080 -15.00 -10.00 -5.00 0.00 5.00 10.00 15.00 20.001,000 Normal Deviates with Mean = 3, Sigma = 5 Created with Norm.Inv(Rand()) 630 Chapter 24 Getting Ahead of Ourselves: Do We Prefer Norm.S.Inv or Norm.Inv? Ultimately our goal is to simulate stock returns; these (as we discuss in Chapter 26) are generally assumed to be normally distributed. If we are simulating the returns of a stock based on annual mean μ and standard deviation σ , then it is obviously more convenient to use Norm.S.Inv(rand( ), μ , σ ) . As we discuss in Chapter 26, if ( μ , σ ) are the annual statistics of the stock return, and if we divide the year into n subperiods, then the periodic stock returns can be simulated with Norm.Inv(Rand(), , ) msDDtt , where Δ t = 1/ n . On the other hand, much financial theory is phrased in terms of lognormal price processes. These are generally written as rt t Z=+μσΔΔ where Z is a standard normal deviate. To conform to this writing, it is often more convenient (and theoretically equivalent) to simulate returns by: rt t=+μσΔΔ Norm.S.Inv(Rand( )) In this book we interchangeably use both writings. 24.6 Generating Correlated Random Numbers In this section we show how to produce correlated pseudo-random numbers. We start by showing how to generate two correlated normal and uniform random numbers and then go on to the multivariate case. 631 Generating and Using Random Numbers 1 2 3 4 567 8 9 1011 12 13 14 1516 17 181920E D C B A ρ 0.6 ) 1 1 0 1 D : 2 1 D ( E G A R E V A = - - < 6 2 0 0 . 0 5 1 5 0 . 0 - 1 3 7 0 . 0 n a e M ) 1 1 0 1 D : 2 1 D ( S .

Defining zz z31 221 =+ −ρρ , we create a set of simulates that has the desired correlation with Z 1 : 632 Chapter 24 On the next page we give the scatter plots for a number of simulations with different correlation coefficients ρ . Example 2: Two Correlated Uniform Variables To create uniform variables that are correlated, we first produce correlated standard normal variables, and then use Norm.S.Dist to produce the uniform variables. Here ’ s the procedure: • Use Norm.S.Inv(Rand( )) to produce two random numbers that are nor- mally distributed. Call these numbers z 1 and z 2 . • Let zz z31 221 =+ −ρρ . As we showed above z 3 and z 1 are correlated with correlation ρ . 11 12 13 14 15 1617 18 1920 21 222324 25 2627 28 2930 31 3233 34 3536 37 383940 41 4243 44GH I J K LMNOPQR Z1 Z2 Z3 - 4 000 -3.8 0 0 0 -3.6 0 0 0 -3.4 0 1 1 -3.2 0 1 0 - 3 002 -2.8 1 0 1 -2.6 3 3 3 -2.4 4 1 1 -2.2 3 4 5 - 2 876 - 1 . 8 1 21 41 4 - 1 . 6 1 82 11 6- 1 . 4 2 61 62 6 - 1 . 2 4 63 72 3 -1 39 57 43 - 0 . 8 5 16 55 1- 0 . 6 4 86 26 6 - 0 . 4 6 55 27 4- 0 . 2 7 47 89 7 08 1 8 1 7 4 0 . 2 8 28 28 00 . 4 8 07 37 9 0 . 6 7 18 46 6 0 . 8 7 65 94 6 15 3 5 2 6 0 1 . 2 4 23 64 4 1 . 4 3 53 44 1 1 . 6 2 72 22 51 . 8 2 02 42 6 2 8 12 9Frequency distribution, Z 1, Z2, Z3 -4.0000-3.0000-2.0000-1.00000.00001.00002.00003.00004.00005.0000 -4.0000 -3.0000 -2.0000 -1.0000 0.0000 1.0000 2.0000 3.0000 4.0000Sca/g425er Plot of Z1 vs Z3, rho = 0.6 0102030405060708090100 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4Frequencies: Z1, Z2, Z3 Z1 Z2 Z3 The frequencies and distributions are shown below: 633 Generating and Using Random Numbers We show this routine twice.

A Small Case 8 Jacob has just retired at age 65 with savings of $1 million. He intends to invest 60% of this in a market index fund and the remaining 40% in a risk-free asset. He estimates the return on the risk-free asset as r f = 3% annually, and he estimates that the market portfolio will have normally distributed returns with mean return μ = 11% and σ = 20%. Jacob intends to withdraw $50,000 from his account at the beginning of this year. He thinks that this amount will, on average grow at 3% per year, with a standard deviation of 10%. Furthermore, he thinks that the growth rate of his annual spending will be correlated ρ = 0.5 with the stock market. 9 Our question: If Jacob ’ s life expectancy is age 90, how much will he leave to his beloved son, Simon? Here ’ s a simulation that answers this question (some rows are hidden): 8. This section uses some materials from Chapter 26 and may be skipped on first reading. 9. His theory: When the market goes up, everyone spends more! 636 Chapter 24 Some details of the simulation: • Whatever savings are left at the end of a particular year constitute the initial savings for the next year. • Z 1 and Z 2 are correlated standard normal variables. Note the formulas: Z ZZ1 21= =∗ + − ∗Norm.S.Inv Rand Sqrt 1 Norm.S.Inv Rand2( ( )), () ( ( ρ r )) In this particular simulation, Jacob leaves $906,029 for his heirs.

A square matrix is called upper triangular if it has non-zero entries only on the diagonal and elements above the diagonal. A square matrix is called lower triangular if (you can fill in the blanks). The French mathematician André-Louis Cholesky (1875–1918) proved that any symmetric positive-definite matrix S can be written as the product of a lower-triangular matrix L and its transpose L T . This is the Cholesky decomposition . Example In the example below cells B2:B5 contain a 4x4 variance-covariance matrix. Cells B8:D11 contain the Cholesky decomposition of this matrix—a lower-triangular matrix L . Cells B14:D17 multiply L times its transpose: As you can see, the result is to give back the original variance-covariance matrix. 1 234 5 6789 101112 13 1415 16 17E D C B A 0.400 0.030 0.020 0.0000.030 0.200 0.000 -0.0600.020 0.000 0.300 0.030 0.000 -0.060 0.030 0.100 0.632 0.000 0.000 0.000 <-- {=cholesky(A2:D5)} 0.047 0.445 0.000 0.0000.032 -0.003 0.547 0.0000.000 -0.135 0.054 0.281 0.400 0.030 0.020 0.000 <-- {=MMULT(A8:D11,TRANSPOSE(A8:D11))} 0.030 0.200 0.000 -0.060 0.020 0.000 0.300 0.030 0.000 -0.060 0.030 0.100Check: Mul/g415ply above matrix by its transposeCholesky decomposi/g415on, LVariance-covariance matrix, S 640 Chapter 24 The function Cholesky can be found on the disk that accompanies Financial Modeling . 10 Using the Cholesky Decomposition to Produce Correlated Normal Simulates We start off with a varcov matrix S=⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦σσσσ σσσσ σσσσ σσσσ11 12 13 14 21 22 23 24 31 32 33 3441 42 43 44⎥ ⎥ ⎥⎥⎥ .

My thanks to Antoine Jacquier, who posted this on Wilmott.com and has allowed me to use it in this book. 641 Generating and Using Random Numbers In cells A15:A18 we use NormSInv and Rand to produce four random numbers, each of which is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation 1. 11 In cells B21:B24 we pre-multiply this random vector by the Cholesky matrix in cells A9:D12. The claim is that the numbers in A21:A24 are normally distributed with mean zero and the variance-covariance structure given by the varcov matrix. We cannot, of course, prove this claim from a single simulation.

In the sense of “hitting” targets—it is much more difficult to hit the means than to hit the variances. This sentence has an almost metaphysical meaning: When we compute asset means from historical returns—even if all the returns are drawn from a stationary distribution (i.e., with unchanging means, variances, and covariances), we are very unlikely in a small sample to get close to the actual mean of the distribution. On the other hand, we are much more likely to be close to the variances. The covariances are also very difficult to hit. 648 Chapter 24 24.10 Multivariate Uniform Simulations Once we have simulated correlated normal distributions, we can easily simu- late uniform distributions by using Norm.S.Dist .

This chapter has introduced you to the Excel and VBA random-number generators and has shown a number of techniques for producing normally distributed random numbers. Exercises 1. Here is a random-number generator you can make yourself: • Start with some number, Seed . • Let X 1 = Seed + π . Let XeX 25 1=+ln( ) . • The first random number is Random = X 2 − Integer ( X 2 ), where Integer ( X 2 ) is the integer part of X 2 . • Repeat the process, letting Seed = Random .

Write a VBA Exercise1(seed) that produces a random number based on a Seed and the rule of the previous exercise. 3. Define AmodB as the remainder when A is divided by B . For example 36mod25 = 11. Excel has this function; it is written Mod(A,B) . Now here is another random-number generator: • Let X 0 = seed . • Let X n + 1 = ( 7*X n )mod10 8 . • Let U n + 1 = X n + 1 /10 8 . The list of numbers U 1 , U 2 , … are the pseudo-random numbers generated by this random- number generator. (This is one of the many uniform random-number generators given in Abramowitz and Stegun, 1972). 4. Many states have daily lotteries, which are played as follows: Sometime during the day, you buy a lottery ticket, on which the seller inscribes a number you choose, between 000 and 999. That night there is a drawing on television in which a three-digit number is drawn. If the number on your ticket matches the number drawn, you win and collect $500. If you lose, you get nothing. a. Write an Excel function which produces a random number between 000 and 999. (Hint: Use Rand( ) and Int( ) .) b. Assume that you bet $1 every day of the year on the same number. Show your cumula- tive winnings throughout the year. 5. Tareq and Jamillah are playing with a single die for money. According to the rules of their game, Tareq pays Jamillah $0.50 at the start of every round, before they throw a die. They then throw the die; if it falls on an even number, Jamillah pays that amount in dollars to Tareq, and if it falls on an odd number, Tareq pays that amount to Jamillah. • Simulate Jamillah ’ s cumulative winnings after 25 rounds of the game. • Simulate 50 games, and graph the results 6. Stock price simulation: A stock ’ s price is lognormally distributed with mean μ = 15%. The current stock price is S 0 = 35.

Use these random numbers to simulate the stock price path over 60 months. Create price paths for σ = 15%, 30%, and 60% and graph these three paths on the same axes. 653 Generating and Using Random Numbers 7.

He has a new job and intends to save $10,000 today and in each of the next 34 years (35 deposits altogether). He has decided on an investment policy in which he invests 30% of his assets in a risk-free bond with 3% continuously compounded annual interest and the remainder in the market portfolio that has lognormal returns μ = 12% and σ = 35%.

Marcus decides that he needs at least $2 million by the time he hits 60. • Run 100 simulations in order to determine the approximate probability of achieving this goal. • Compute the average and standard deviation of the terminal wealth. • Create a Data Table to determine the relation between the proportion invested in the risky asset and the probability of achieving the minimum at 60. Set the proportions in the risky asset to 0%, 10%, … , 100%. 10. Martha is playing a coin-toss game in which she tosses two coins. The probability of heads on the second coin is correlated with correlation ρ = 0.6 with the probability of heads on the first coin. In this particular game, Martha wins $1 for each heads that she tosses. • Model one round of 2 coin tosses. • If she plays 10 rounds of 2 coin tosses each, how much will she win? • Use Data Table on a blank cell to model 25 cycles of this 10-round game. 2 5 An Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods 25.1 Overview “Monte Carlo” (MC) methods refer to a variety of random simulations used to determine the values of parameters. In this introductory chapter to MC methods, we use MC to determine the value of π . In subsequent chapters we use MC to gain insight into investment and option strategies. The Monte Carlo method has its source in physics, where it is often used to determine model values for which there is no analytical solution. 1 One use of Monte Carlo in finance is similar: Monte Carlo methods use simulation to price assets whose prices are not readily determined by analytical means. In short: If there isn ’ t a formula for computing the value of an asset, maybe we can determine its value with a simulation. In Chapters 27–30 we also use Monte Carlo methods to give a feel for the uncertainty surrounding various investment and option strategies. When we do this, we are not necessarily interested in the pricing implications of uncer-tainty—we want to illustrate what kinds of results can occur from a given investment strategy in assets whose returns are uncertain. In this chapter we give a layperson ’ s introduction to Monte Carlo pricing. 2 We assume that you have read Chapter 24, which gives an introduction to random numbers. 25.2 Computing π Using Monte Carlo All Monte Carlo methods involve random simulation. We illustrate how to use Monte Carlo to calculate the value of π , a number with which you are presum- ably familiar. Here ’ s our method: We know that the area of the unit circle (circle with radius 1) is π . It follows that the area of a quarter circle is π /4. We inscribe a quarter circle into a unit square, as illustrated below. We then proceed to “shoot” random points at the unit square. Each random point has an x com- ponent and a y component. We generate such points by using the Excel func- tion Rand . 1. Two good websites with introductions to Monte Carlo methods are www.ornl.gov/ ∼ pk7/thesis/ pkthnode19.html and www.puc-rio.br/marco.ind/monte-carlo.html . 2. An excellent nonintroductory text is Glasserman (2005). 656 Chapter 25 The picture below shows the quarter circle inscribed in the unit square and a single random point, which happened to land inside the circle.

In some cases, the point will be outside the unit circle: 657 An Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods We can easily do a calculation of the probability that the point will be inside the circle: • The area of the whole unit circle is π * r 2 = π . Thus the area of the quarter unit circle is π /4. • The random point—generated by {Rand( ), Rand( )} —is always inside the unit square, whose area is 1. • Thus the probability of the random point being inside the unit circle is Area unit circle Area unit square==ππ//4 14 Quarter Unit Circle Showing single random point {rand(),rand()} 00.10.20.30.40.50.60.70.80.91 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 658 Chapter 25 Monte Carlo approximation of Relative number points inside uniπ =∗4 tt circle Number points inside uni t circle Total number of points=∗4 In the spreadsheet below we generate a list of random numbers (columns B and C) and then use a Boolean function to test whether the numbers are in or out of the unit circle. In row 8 below, for example, the function = (B8 ∧ 2 + C8 ∧ 2 < = 1) returns TRUE if the sum of the squares of B8 and C8 are less than or equal to 1 and 0 otherwise. In cell B2 we use Count to count the number of total points generated, and CountIf to determine the number of data points which fall inside the unit circle. 3 3. All of the functions in this paragraph—Boolean functions, Count, and CountIf —are discussed in Chapter 33. Monte Carlo Computation of π If we count the relative number of points which fall inside the unit circle, we should approximate π /4. Thus 659 An Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods Each time we press F9 to recalculate the spreadsheet, we get different values for the = Rand , and hence a different Monte Carlo value for π .

Using more data points makes our MC value for π more accurate, though none of these values is that close to the actual value of π . 4 25.3 Writing a VBA Program This Monte Carlo business requires some VBA. Here ’ s a program: 4. The actual value of π , correct to 50 digits, is 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841 971693993751. One of the end-of-chapter problems shows you a quick way of computing this value using several remarkable functions due to the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887–1920). 662 Chapter 25 Sub MonteCarlo() n = Range(“Number”) Hits = 0 For Index = 1 To n If Rnd ∧ 2 + Rnd ∧ 2 < 1 _ Then Hits = Hits + 1 Next Index Range(“Estimate”) = 4 * Hits / n End Sub The spreadsheet below shows this program and two other VBA programs. The program MonteCarloTimer computes both the StartTime and the StopTime , so that we can compute the elapsed time for the computations. Below, you can see that 10 million iterations of the program took 4 seconds on the author ’ s Lenovo T420s laptop. The program MonteCarloTimeRecord records each iteration of the program on the screen. This VBA routine allows you to see how the values of π in cell B3 develop. You can stop this or any VBA routine in midstream by pressing [Ctrl] + [Break]. This macro is incredibly time wasteful. It took us 103 seconds to run 5,000 iterations of the routine (compare this to running the 20 million iterations without the screen updating). 663 An Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods 25.4 Another Monte Carlo Problem: Investment and Retirement 5 The problem: You are 65 years old and you have $1,000,000. You are trying to decide on a mix of investments: There is a riskless bond with an annual return of 6% and a risky stock portfolio with an expected log return of 12% and a standard deviation of return of 30%. Your limitations: You want to take $150,000 out of the account every year and have something left over at age 75. To get a better handle on this situation, you plot out a spreadsheet: 1 2 34 5 678 9 10 1112 13 14 15 161718 19 202122 23 2425 26 272829 30 3132 33 343536 37E D C B A Number of data points 10,000,000 <-- This cell called \"Number\" Sub MonteCarlo() ) \" r e b m u N \" ( e g n a R = n \" e t a m i t s E \" d e l l a c l l e c s i h T - - < 8 0 5 4 1 4 1 . 3 ? i P Hits = 0 For Index = 1 To n 1 + s t i H = s t i H n e h T 1 < 2 ^ d n R + 2 ^ d n R f I \" e m i T t r a t S \" d e l l a c l l e c s i h T - - < 9 4 : 9 5 : 0 1 e m i T t r a t S x e d n I t x e N \" e m i T p o t S \" d e l l a c l l e c s i h T - - < 3 5 : 9 5 : 0 1 e m i T p o t S n / s t i H * 4 = ) \" e t a m i t s E \" ( e g n a R e m i T t r a t S - e m i t p o t S = - - < 4 0 : 0 0 : 0 d e s p a l E End Sub Note Sub MonteCarloTime() r e m i t s e d u l c n I ' \" o l r a C e t n o M \" o r c a m e h t s n u r a + ] l r t C [ [Ctrl]+e runs the macro \"MonteCarloTime\" which also records the time n = Range(\"Number\") Range(\"StartTime\") = Time n = Range(\"Number\") Hits = 0 For Index = 1 To n If Rnd ^ 2 + Rnd ^ 2 < 1 Then Hits = Hits + 1 Next Index Range(\"Estimate\") = 4 * Hits / n Range(\"StopTime\") = Time End Sub Sub MonteCarloTimeRecord() 'Records everything (takes a long time) n = Range(\"Number\") Range(\"StartTime\") = Time n = Range(\"Number\") Hits = 0 For Index = 1 To n Range(\"Number\") = Index If Rnd ^ 2 + Rnd ^ 2 < 1 Then Hits = Hits + 1 Range(\"Estimate\") = 4 * Hits / Index Range(\"StopTime\") = Time Next Index End SubCOMPUTING PI USING VBA [Ctrl]+f runs the macro \"MonteCarloTimeRecord\" which records the results as they are generated.

The material in the remainder of the chapter anticipates some results of the next several chap- ters and can be skipped on first reading. 664 Chapter 25 In this spreadsheet column B shows the wealth at the beginning of every year. The wealth is divided between risky and riskless investments according to the proportions in cell B7. The riskless investment earns a continuously compounded return of 6% (meaning: $100 invested in the riskless grows to 100* e 6% at the end of the year). The risky part of the investment grows by a factor of e μ + σ * Z = e 8% + 20%* Z , where Z is a random number which is normally distributed with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. As explained in Chapter 24, one way of generating these numbers is to use the Excel function Norm.S.Inv(Rand( )) . With each press of F9 , this function recomputes and produces another normally distributed random number. In the above simulation the investor has money left at the end of the 10-year period. But it is clear that not every simulation will leave the investor with spare cash at the end of year 10. A few presses of F9 to recalculate the spread- sheet will produce something like this: 1 2 34 5 67 8 9 1011 12 1314 15 16 17181920 21 22 23 24 25 26 27AB C D E F G H I Current wealth 1,000,000 % 6 e t a r e e r f - k s i R Parameters of risky investment Expected annual return 8% Standard deviation of return 20% Proportion invested in risky 70% Annual drawdown 150,000 YearWealth at beginning of yearInvested in riskyInvested in bondsRandom number, normally distributed1+return on risky investmentWealth at end of yearDrawdownLeft at end of 10 years 1 1,000,000 700,000 300,000 -0.6530 0.9507 984,011 150,000 2 834,011 583,808 250,203 1.9864 1.6117 1,206,595 150,000 3 1,056,595 739,616 316,978 -0.4627 0.9875 1,066,981 150,000 4 916,981 641,887 275,094 0.3292 1.1570 1,034,774 150,000 5 884,774 619,342 265,432 -0.1634 1.0485 931,203 150,000 6 781,203 546,842 234,361 -0.0306 1.0767 837,625 150,000 7 687,625 481,338 206,288 -1.7297 0.7665 587,982 150,000 8 437,982 306,587 131,395 0.8048 1.2725 529,639 150,000 9 379,639 265,748 113,892 0.5611 1.2119 443,005 150,000 10 293,005 205,104 87,902 -0.0473 1.0731 313,431 150,000 163,431 Investment in risky asset =B20*$B$7PLANNING YOUR RETIREMENT =C20*F20+D20*EXP($B$3)Normally distributed random numbers generated by =NORM.S.INV(RAND()) 1+return on risky investment =EXP ($B$5+$B$6*E20 )Wealth at beginning of year =G19-H19 665 An Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods What interests us is what percentage of the investment-consumption paths will end with a positive remainder ? We will use Monte Carlo techniques to answer this question. But before we do, we consider an economic question. Should We Apply the 70% Rule Blindly? In the above simulations we have split our investment between the risky and the riskless investments mechanically. We have also continued to draw down funds irrespective of whether there are funds in the account. In the spreadsheet below we correct this. We assume that the investor defines a “safety cushion.” The cushion in cell B8 below is 3, which is taken to mean that the annual drawdown is $150,000 if the investor ’ s portfolio is worth at least 3*$150,000 at the end of the year. If this is not true, then the investor takes 1/3 of her portfolio value as a drawdown: 1 2 34 5 6789 1011121314 15 1617 18 1920 21 22 23 24 25 2627AB C D E F G H I Current wealth 1,000,000 % 6 e t a r e e r f k s i R Parameters of risky investment Expected annual return 8% Standard deviation of return 20% Proportion invested in risky 70% Annual drawdown 150,000 YearWealth at beginning of yearInvested in riskyInvested in bondsRandom number, normally distributed1+return on risky investmentWealth at end of yearDrawdownLeft at end of 10 years 1 1,000,000 700,000 300,000 0.4850 1.1936 1,154,087 150,000 2 1,004,087 702,861 301,226 1.2441 1.3893 1,296,359 150,000 3 1,146,359 802,451 343,908 1.9765 1.6085 1,655,924 150,000 4 1,505,924 1,054,147 451,777 -0.1250 1.0565 1,593,464 150,000 5 1,443,464 1,010,425 433,039 -0.5280 0.9747 1,444,709 150,000 6 1,294,709 906,296 388,413 -0.2036 1.0401 1,355,033 150,000 7 1,205,033 843,523 361,510 -1.6497 0.7788 1,040,840 150,000 8 890,840 623,588 267,252 0.3517 1.1622 1,008,528 150,000 9 858,528 600,970 257,559 -0.7976 0.9236 828,516 150,000 10 678,516 474,961 203,555 -0.7732 0.9281 656,939 150,000 506,939 Investment in risky asset =B20*$B$7PLANNING YOUR RETIREMENT =C20*F20+D20*EXP($B$3)Normally-distributed random numbers generated by =NORM.S.INV(RAND()) 1+return on risky investment =EXP ($B$5+$B$6*E20 )Wealth at beginning of year =G19-H19 666 Chapter 25 Many rules like this can be devised. The problem here—phrased as invest- ment and payouts over retirement—is substantially the same as that faced by any endowment manager struggling with the problem of how to determine simultaneously the investment and the drawdown policy of the endowment. As far as we know there is no analytical solution to this problem, though as can be seen, it is not difficult to simulate the problem. 1 2 345 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 141516 17 1819 20 2122 23 24 25 26 27 28AB C D E F G H I Current wealth 1,000,000 % 6 e t a r e e r f k s i R Parameters of risky investment Expected annual return 8% Standard deviation of return 20% Proportion invested in risky 70% 3 n o i h s u c y t e f a S Annual drawdown 150,000 YearWealth at beginning of yearInvested in riskyInvested in bondsRandom number, normally distributed1+return on risky investmentWealth at end of yearDrawdownLeft at end of 10 years 1 1,000,000 700,000 300,000 -0.5471 0.9710 998,253 150,000 2 848,253 593,777 254,476 0.4716 1.1904 977,072 150,000 3 827,072 578,950 248,121 -0.8906 0.9065 788,306 150,000 4 638,306 446,814 191,492 0.4212 1.1785 729,907 150,000 5 579,907 405,935 173,972 0.9129 1.3003 712,560 150,000 6 562,560 393,792 168,768 0.0895 1.1029 613,500 150,000 7 463,500 324,450 139,050 -0.3590 1.0082 474,770 150,000 8 324,770 227,339 97,431 -0.9809 0.8903 305,860 101,953 9 203,906 142,734 61,172 -1.1469 0.8612 187,882 62,627 10 125,255 87,678 37,576 -0.2989 1.0204 129,369 43,123 86,246 Investment in risky asset =B21*$B$7PLANNING YOUR RETIREMENT Using a safety cushion of 3 Investor takes 150,000 if end-year wealth > 3*150,000, else takes end-year wealth/3 =C21*F21+D21*EXP($B$3)Normally-distributed random numbers generated by =NORMSINV(RAND()) 1+return on risky investment =EXP($B$5+$B$6*E21)Wealth at beginning of year =G20-H20 Drawdown calculated as =IF(G21>$B$8*$B$9,$B$9,G21/$B$8) 667 An Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods There are 20 rows in the Data Table , though only 12 are shown. When we select OK , we run the simulation 20 times. Here is one run and some statistics. Pressing F9 will run the simulation again: 25.5 A Monte Carlo Simulation of the Investment Problem In this section we run multiple simulations of the investment problem. The first set of simulations is run in the Excel spreadsheet itself, using the technique of “Data table on a blank cell” explained in section 31.7. The second set of simulations is run in VBA. Data Table on a Blank Cell We set up a Data Table on the investment simulation spreadsheet. Note that the data table header refers to the bequest in cell I20 and that the Column input cell in the Data Table dialog box refers to an empty cell. This is the technique explained in section 31.7: 668 Chapter 25 Running the Simulation in VBA We write a VBA function SuccessfulRuns , which simulates the above problem. Given an investment policy, the function SuccessfulRuns determines the per- centage of investment/drawdown trajectories which will leave the retiree with positive wealth at the end of his investment horizon. 5 6 7 89 101112131415161718192021 22 23 24 25 2627 28 29 30 31KLM NOPQ Average 227,828 <-- =AVERAGE(L12:L30) Sigma 401,551 <-- =STDEV.S(L12:L31) Negative bequest 30% <-- =COUNTIF(L12:L31,\"<0\")/COUNT(L12:L31) Simulation 220,554 <-- =I20, data table header 1 -77,4382 372,0053 242,1344 -94,0785 754,7226 145,9137 -447,9538 211,7919 808,196 10 724,259 11 -352,192 12 -136,035 13 263,919 14 106,654 15 809,09416 378,955 17 -193,356 18 699,718 19 112,415 20 753,354Below: Data table 669 An Introduction to Monte Carlo Methods The function result in cell B13 considers a retiree starting with $1 million, making an investment decision between a risk-free asset with return 7% and a risky asset with stochastic returns μ = 10% and σ = 40%, and desiring to draw down $100,000 per year. Simulating 1,000 returns, we determine that in 87.6% of the cases the investor will finish with positive wealth at the end of 10 years.

In this chapter we have used the example of π to illustrate how Monte Carlo might be applied. As a valuation tool, MC methods are to be avoided when there is another, closed-form, way of deter-mining the value. As we illustrate in exercises to this chapter, MC is not a good way to compute the value of π , given that many excellent formulas exist that approximate π with great accuracy. In cases where this is not true, however, you can use Monte Carlo to approximate the value. Monte Carlo methods can also be used to simulate investment problems in order to gain insight into the meaning of asset return uncertainty. In this chapter we illustrated this with some investment examples. Exercises 1. In section 25.2 we designed a macro which calculates the value of π using Monte Carlo and which updates the screen every iteration. Modify the macro so that it updates the screen only every 1,000 iterations. Hints: • Use the VBA function Mod . From the VBA help menu, note that this function has syntax a Mod b. (A similar Excel function has syntax Mod(a,b) , but cannot be used in VBA.) • Use the VBA commands Application.ScreenUpdating = True and Application. ScreenUpdating = False to control the updating of the screen. 2. In the previous exercise, put a “switch” on the spreadsheet itself, which controls the updat- ing of the macro (whether to update, yes or no, and how often to update). 3. Use Monte Carlo to calculate the integral of the function Exp( x ) for 0 < x < 3. Here ’ s the graph of this function: Next j If PortfolioValue(Years) > 0 _ Then Success = Success + 1 Next Index SuccessfulRuns = Success / Runs End Function 672 Chapter 25 4. One of the messages of this chapter is that while Monte Carlo is a clever method of cal- culation, it shouldn ’ t be used when some better method exists. The MC valuation of π in section 25.2, for example, converges very slowly. It ’ s a crummy way to compute π , since there are well-known methods for doing this. To see this, answer the following questions: • Approximately how many runs does it require until you get 4-decimal accuracy for π using our MC simulation? • Approximately how many runs does it require until you get 8-decimal accuracy for π using our MC simulation? • Approximately how many runs does it require until you get 16-decimal accuracy for π using our MC simulation? Note on exercises 5 and 6: We show you two alternative ways to compute the value of π . Both are substantially better than Monte Carlo! 5. The first method for computing π is: π2 22611 21 3=+ + + … Use this formula to approximate π . 6.

Use this series to construct a VBA function to value π , where n is the number of terms in the series. Show that two iterations give you over 15 digits of accuracy. Some Comments on the Value of π Exercise 6 is based on an article by D. H. Bailey, J. M. Borwein, and P. B. Borwein: “Ramanujan, Modular Equations, and Approximations to π Or How to Compute One Billion Digits of Pi.” The article originally appeared in the American Mathematical Monthly , 1987, volume 96, number 3, pages 201–219. It can be downloaded at http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/organics/papers/borwein/index.html . Ramanujan ’ s method in exercise 6 adds roughly 8 digits with each iteration. Ramanujan developed an even faster method, where only 13 iterations provide more than 1 billion digits of π . (Excel ’ s maximal accu- racy is only 15 digits, but there is a nice Excel add-in which extends the precision to 32,767 digits: http://precisioncalc.com/ ). Srinivasan Ramanujan (1887–1920) was one of the great mathematical geniuses of all time.

Published by Charles Scribner, 1991 (paper-back edition—Washington Square Press, 1992). Finally: So what ’ s the value of π ?

By simulating asset prices, we hope to answer questions relating to the investment outcomes such as: • What is the probability that a given savings/spending pattern over time will enable a positive pension bequest? • What is the likelihood that a discretely updated portfolio approach to option replication will successfully duplicate the option outcome? • How can we price options whose terminal prices depend on the price path of an asset? In order to simulate prices, we must have some assumptions about the dis- tributional properties of stock prices. The standard finance assumption is that stock prices are lognormally distributed or, equivalently, that stock returns are normally distributed. In this chapter we give meaning to these two statements and show how they can be simulated in Excel. Subsequent chapters of Section V apply these concepts to the modeling of investments and options. We have touched on this topic in our discussion of option pricing. In Chapter 16 we discussed the assumption that the development of a stock price over time follows a binomial model. We return to the binomial model in Chapter 30, where we use it to show Monte Carlo price-path-dependent options. In Chapter 17, we showed that the Black-Scholes model uses the assumption that stock prices are lognormally distributed. On a deeper level, we showed numeri-cally in section 16.7 that the binomial model is in the limit equivalent to the assumption of lognormality. We did this by showing that the limiting price of a binomial option pricing model is the Black-Scholes price. This chapter focuses on the lognormality of prices and shows how this assumption can be simulated. The structure of the chapter is as follows: • We start with a discussion of what constitutes “reasonable” assumptions about stock prices. • We then discuss why the lognormal distribution is a reasonable distribution for stock prices. • Next, we show how to simulate lognormal price paths. • Finally, we show you how to derive the parameters of the lognormal distribution—the mean and standard deviation of the stock returns—from historical stock price data. 676 Chapter 26 26.2 What Do Stock Prices Look Like? What are reasonable assumptions about the way stock prices behave over time? Clearly the price of a stock (or any other risky financial asset) is uncertain. What is its distribution? This is a perplexing question. One way to answer this question is to ask what are reasonable statistical properties of a stock price. Here are five reasonable properties: 1. The stock price is uncertain. Given the price today, we do not know the price tomorrow. 2. Changes in the stock ’ s price are continuous. Over short periods of time, changes in a stock ’ s price are very small, and the change goes to zero as the time span goes to zero. 1 3. The stock price is never zero. This property means that we exclude the stocks of “dead” companies. 4. The average return from holding a stock tends to increase over time. Notice the word “tends”: We do not know that holding a stock for a longer time will lead to a higher return; however, we expect that holding a risky asset over a longer term will lead to a higher average return. 5. The uncertainty associated with the return from holding a stock also tends to increase the longer the stock is held. Thus, given the stock ’ s price today, the variance of the stock price tomorrow is small; however, the price variance in 1 month is larger, and the variance in 1 year is larger still. Reasonable Stock Properties and Stock Price Paths One way of viewing these five “reasonable properties” of stock prices is to think about price paths . A stock price path is a graph of a stock price over a period of time. Here, for example, are the price paths of several stocks: 1. If you have watched stock prices, you know that continuity is usually not a bad assumption. Sometimes, however, it can be disastrous (look at the way stock market prices behaved in October 1987, for a dramatic example of price discontinuities ). It is possible to build a stock price model that assumes that prices are usually continuous but have occasional (and random) jumps. See Cox and Ross (1976), Merton (1976), and Jarrow and Rudd (1983). 677 Simulating Stock Prices If we simulated stock price paths (something we will do using the lognormal model later in this chapter), how would we expect them to look? Our five properties imply that we would expect: 1. Wiggly lines. 2. Lines that are continuous (solid), with no jumps. 3. Lines that are always positive and never cross zero, no matter how low they get. 4. That at a given point in time, the average over all plausible lines is greater than the initial price of the stock. The farther out we go, the higher this average becomes. 5. That the standard deviation over all plausible lines is greater the farther out we go. Here ’ s another way of thinking about stock prices. Suppose we take the daily returns on the Standard & Poor ’ s 500 index (we only show the start of the data): 0102030405060Jan-02Jan-03Jan-04Jan-05Jan-06Jan-07Jan-08Jan-09Jan-10Jan-11Jan-12Daily Prices for 3 Stocks January 2002- December 2011 Kellogg GE HPQ 678 Chapter 26 If we graph these returns over any given period, we get a mess of dots which is difficult to interpret: 1 2345 6 789 1011 12 131415ABC D Date Price Return 03-01-50 16.6604-01-50 16.85 1.13% <-- =LN(B4/B3)05-01-50 16.93 0.47% 06-01-50 16.98 0.29% 09-01-50 17.08 0.59%10-01-50 17.03 -0.29%11-01-50 17.09 0.35%12-01-50 16.76 -1.95%13-01-50 16.67 -0.54% 16-01-50 16.72 0.30% 17-01-50 16.86 0.83%18-01-50 16.85 -0.06%19-01-50 16.87 0.12%SP500 DAILY PRICES 1950-2011 -25%-20%-15%-10%-5%0%5%10%15%Standard & Poors 500 Daily Returns, 1950-2011 679 Simulating Stock Prices We have marked the largest daily increase and decline with circles: –22.9% on 19 October 1987 and + 10.96% on 13 October 2008.

This number is used to convert the average daily return and stan-dard deviation of daily return to annual statistics: Ⴜ Average annual return = (days per year) * (average daily return) Ⴜ Standard deviation of annual return = Sqrt(days per year) * stan- dard deviation of daily return • To compute the date on which the max and min returns occur, we use the Excel functions Match and Ⴜ MATCH(G6,$C$3:$C$15604,0) finds the row in the range C3:C15604 in which the value in G6 (the max return) occurs. Ⴜ INDEX($A$3:$A$15604,MATCH(G6,$C$3:$C$15604,0)) finds the value in row MATCH(G6,$C$3:$C$15604,0) in A3:A15604 . This is the date of the occurrence. Computing Returns and Their Distribution for a Continuous Return-Generating Process 2 We can compute the stock return over a period by taking the natural logarithm of the price relatives, defined as lnPrice Pricet t−⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ 1 . Furthermore, if { r 1 , r 2 , … , r M } is a series of periodic returns, we can compute the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the returns as: 2.

We then relate the lognormal price process to a geometric diffusion. Suppose we denote by S t the price at time t of a share of stock. The lognor- mal distribution assumes that the natural logarithm of one-plus-the-return from holding a share of stock between time t and time t + Δ t is normally distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ . Denote the (uncertain) rate of return over an interval Δ t by /tildenosprtΔ . Then we can write SSr ttt t t+= [] ΔΔ Δ exp /tildenosp . In the lognormal distribution, we assume that the rate of return /tildenosprtΔ over a short period Δ t is normally distributed with mean μ Δ t and variance σ 2 Δ t . Another way of writing this relation is to write the stock price S t + Δ t at time t + Δ t in the following way: 682 Chapter 26 S StZ ttt t+=+ ⎡⎣⎤⎦ΔΔΔ exp μσ where Z is a standard normal variable (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). 3 To see what this assumption means, suppose first that σ = 0. In this case we have SS ttt t+= [] Δ Δ exp μ which simply says that the stock price grows at an exponential rate with cer- tainty. In this case the stock is like a riskless bond that bears interest rate μ , continuously compounded. Now suppose that σ > 0. In this case, the lognormal assumption says that, although the tendency is for the stock price to increase, there is an uncertain element (normally distributed) that must be taken into account. The best way to think about this is in terms of a simulation. Suppose, for example, that we ’ re trying to simulate a lognormal price process in which μ = 15%, σ = 30%, and Δ t = 0.004. Suppose the price at time 0 is S 0 = 35. To simulate the possible stock prices at time Δ t we first have to pick (at random) a number Z from a standard normal distribution. 4 Suppose that this number is 0.1165. Then the stock price S Δ t at time Δ t will be SS t Z t tΔ ΔΔ =∗ + ⎡⎣⎤⎦ =∗ + ∗ ∗ ⎡⎣0 35 0 15 0 004 0 3 0 1165 0 004exp exp . * . . . .μσ ⎤ ⎤⎦=35 0985 . Of course we could have drawn a different random number. If, for example, our random number Z had been –0.9102, then we would have SS t Z t tΔ ΔΔ =∗ + ⎡⎣⎤⎦ =∗ ∗ − ∗ −() ∗0 35 0 15 0 004 0 3 0 9102 0 00exp exp . . . . .μσ 4 4 34 4214 ⎡⎣⎤⎦= . 4. See Chapter 24 for techniques (using both Excel and VBA) for generating random numbers. 3. If you know about diffusion processes, then the lognormal price process is a geometric diffusion : dS Sdt dB =+⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟+ μσσ2 2 , where dB is a Wiener process (“white noise”): dB Z dt= , where Z is a standard random variable. 683 Simulating Stock Prices The spreadsheet uses Data|Data Analysis|Random Number Generation to generate a list of 250 standard-normal deviates.

Having picked Z for a particular time interval Δ t , the price S t + Δ t follows. 5. The number of business days in a year is approximately 250. Thus when we define Δ t = 1/250 = 0.004, we are simulating the stock price on a daily basis over the course of a year. 684 Chapter 26 To summarize: In order to simulate the growth of the stock price , when the price follows a lognormal price distribution: • Multiply Δ t (the elapsed time interval) by μ (the average rate of growth). This gives the certain portion of the return. • Take a draw Z from a random variable which is standard normal, and then multiply this draw by σΔt . This gives the uncertain portion of the return. (The square root implies that the variance of the stock ’ s return is linear in time. See below.) • Add the two results and exponentiate. The daily return is exp μσΔΔtZ t+ ⎡⎣⎤⎦ . If the price on date t is S t , then the price on date t + 1 is SS t Z ttt+=+ ⎡⎣⎤⎦ 1 exp μσΔΔ . 26.4 What Does the Lognormal Distribution Look Like? We know that the normal distribution produces a “bell curve.” What about the lognormal distribution? In the following experiment we simulate 1,000 random end-of-year stock prices. The experiment is a continuation of the experiment performed in the previous section; since we are simulating end-of-year prices, we set Δ t = 1. To perform this experiment: 685 Simulating Stock Prices Having produced 1,000 lognormal price relatives exp μσΔΔtZ t+ ⎡⎣⎤⎦ , we can use the array function Frequency( ) (this function is discussed in Chapter 33) to put them into bins. 1 2 3 4 56789 101112131415161718192021222324ABC D E FGH I Mean 22%1000 normally distributed numbersLognormal =exp(mu+sigma*Z) Bins Frequency Sigma 30% Δt 1 -0.723596258 1.0029 0.00 0 -0.447857929 1.0894 0.15 0 -0.695454219 1.0114 0.30 0 1.558892109 1.9891 0.45 0 1.484181666 1.9450 0.60 4 1.698790584 2.0743 0.75 40 0.438406005 1.4212 0.90 89 -0.406621439 1.1030 1.05 155 1.048028935 1.7064 1.20 164 -0.487628995 1.0765 1.35 155 0.594645826 1.4894 1.50 133 -0.483584017 1.0778 1.65 89 1.984662958 2.2601 1.80 51 -0.052540372 1.2266 1.95 40 0.355370275 1.3863 2.10 29 -0.6636526 1.0211 2.25 21 -0.422878657 1.0976 2.40 10 -0.905299657 0.9497 -0.720319804 1.0039-0.954453299 0.9358 1.969010555 2.2495THE LOGNORMAL HISTOGRAM Table above created with the array formula {=FREQUENCY(E:E,G4:G20)}020406080100120140160180 0.0 0.2 0.3 0.5 0.6 0.8 0.9 1.1 1.2 1.4 1.5 1.7 1.8 2.0 2.1 2.3 2.4Lognormal Frequency Distribu Ɵon • We produce a list of 1,000 normal deviates. • We use each normal deviate to produce an end-of-period stock price SS t Zt S Z t10 0 1 =∗ + ⎡⎣⎤⎦=∗ +[] = exp exp , μσ μ σ ΔΔ Δ since • We put the stock prices into bins and produce a histogram.

We shall try to understand, through a simula-tion written in VBA, the meaning of the following sentences: “The price of a stock today is $25. The price of the stock is distributed lognormally, with an annual log mean return of 10% and an annual log standard deviation of 20%.” We want to know how the price of the stock might behave on a daily basis throughout the next year. There are an infinite number of price paths for the stock. What we will do is simulate (randomly) one of these paths. If we want another price path, we can merely rerun the simulation. There are about 250 business days in a year. Therefore the daily price move- ment of the stock between day t and day t + 1 can be simulation by setting Δ t = 1/250 = 0.004, μ = 10%, and σ = 20%. If the initial price of the stock S 0 = $25, then the price after one day will be SS t Z t Z tΔ ΔΔ =∗ + ⎡⎣⎤⎦=∗ ⋅ + ⋅ ⎡⎣⎤⎦ 0 25 0 15 0 004 0 20 0 004 exp exp . . . . μσ and the price after 2 days will be SS Z 0 008 0 004 0 15 0 004 0 20 0 004 .. exp . . . . =∗ ⋅ + ⋅ ⎡⎣⎤⎦ and so on. At each step the random normal deviate Z is the uncertain factor in the price return. Because of this uncertainty, all paths produced will be different. Here is a VBA program PricePathSimulation that reproduces a typical price path: Sub PricePathSimulation() Range(“starttime”) = Time N = Range(“runs”).Value mean = Range(“mean”) sigma = Range(“sigma”) delta_t = 1 / (2 * N) 689 Simulating Stock Prices ReDim price(0 To 2 * N) As Double price(0) = Range(“initial_price”) For Index = 1 To N start: Static rand1, rand2, S1, S2, X1, X2 rand1 = 2 * Rnd - 1 rand2 = 2 * Rnd - 1 S1 = rand1 ∧ 2 + rand2 ∧ 2 If S1 > 1 Then GoTo start S2 = Sqr(-2 * Log(S1) / S1) X1 = rand1 * S2 X2 = rand2 * S2 price(2 * Index - 1) = price(2 * Index - 2) * Exp(mean * delta_t + _ sigma * Sqr(delta_t) * X1) price(2 * Index) = price(2 * Index - 1) * Exp(mean * delta_t + _ sigma * Sqr(delta_t) * X2) Next Index For Index = 0 To 2 * N Range(“output”).Cells(Index + 1, 1) = Index Range(“output”).Cells(Index + 1, 2) = price(Index) Next Index Range(“stoptime”) = Time Range(“elapsed”) = Range(“stoptime”) - Range(“starttime”) Range(“elapsed”).NumberFormat = “hh:mm:ss” End Sub 690 Chapter 26 The output from this program looks like this on the spreadsheet: 1 2 3 456789 1011121314151617181920212223ABCDEFGH I J DayStock price 0 30.00 Runs 125 1 30.33 Initial price 30 2 31.49 Mean 20% 3 31.32 Sigma 30% 43 1.41 53 1.87 63 1.72 73 1.16 83 1.07 93 1.84 10 31.47 11 31.1812 32.1113 31.8414 32.9115 32.9516 32.1717 32.0518 31.8119 32.4020 31.50SIMULATING LOGNORMAL PRICE PATHS WITH VBA Press [Ctrl]+R to operate macro 20253035404550 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250Lognormal Price Simula Ɵon Parameters: Mean = 20%, Sigma = 30% Simulating Price Paths with Norm.Inv In the spreadsheet below we do a similar simulation, using Norm.Inv to simulate the returns (see Chapter 31 for more details).

This accords with properties 4 and 5 of stock prices in section 26.3—we expect both the return on an asset and the uncer-tainty associated with this return to increase over time. 26.6 Technical Analysis Security analysts are divided into “fundamentalists” and “technicians.” This division has nothing to do with their outlook on the Creator of the Universe, but rather with the way they regard stock prices. Fundamentalists believe that the value of a stock is ultimately determined by underlying economic vari-ables. Thus, when a fundamentalist analyzes a company, she will look at its earnings, its debt/equity ratio, its markets, and so forth. 1 2 3456789 10111213141516171819202122232425ABCDEFGH I JK Initial pric e 30 Mu 11% Sigma 30%Delta_t 0.004 <-- =1/250 10 price paths Day Path1 Path2 Path3 Path4 Path5 Path6 Path7 Path8 Path9 Path10 0 30.00 30.00 30.00 30.00 30.00 30.00 30.00 30.00 30.00 30.00 1 29.57 30.08 29.53 30.44 31.15 30.02 29.15 30.62 30.45 29.87 2 28.75 30.73 29.68 30.56 32.71 30.44 28.36 31.25 30.39 29.73 3 28.48 30.83 29.25 32.02 33.54 30.97 28.69 30.47 30.83 29.11 4 27.67 31.86 28.67 32.88 33.92 31.23 28.33 30.12 30.31 30.05 5 27.62 31.27 28.02 31.97 33.35 31.15 29.03 29.65 29.92 29.69 6 27.80 31.81 27.90 32.10 34.63 31.69 28.61 30.14 29.55 29.32 7 27.84 31.45 28.40 31.37 34.50 32.29 29.10 31.26 29.81 30.53 8 28.60 31.93 28.50 31.82 34.35 31.60 29.11 30.68 30.44 31.13 9 29.54 32.18 28.89 31.61 34.70 30.89 28.80 30.79 29.82 30.89 10 29.54 32.31 28.99 32.59 35.41 30.33 28.81 30.72 29.20 31.91 11 29.34 33.47 29.18 32.49 36.12 30.41 29.29 31.12 28.83 31.37 12 28.72 32.26 28.35 32.31 36.99 30.26 29.16 30.18 29.40 30.37 13 28.17 32.57 28.25 31.60 37.23 29.40 28.81 29.66 28.91 30.02 14 28.36 31.59 29.61 31.49 38.44 29.33 28.19 29.12 28.62 30.44 15 28.08 31.69 29.74 32.58 38.04 29.75 27.52 28.43 29.17 29.24 16 27.94 31.73 30.60 32.29 38.22 29.55 27.90 28.29 29.30 30.45SIMULATING 10 LOGNORMAL PRICE PATHS =J9*EXP(Mu*Delta_t+Sigma*SQRT(Delta_ t)*NORM.S.INV(RAND())) 1020304050607080 0 25 50 75 100 125 150 175 200 225 250SimulaƟng 10 Lognormal Price PathsThis normal deviate is then used to simulate the stock price, as illustrated below: 693 Simulating Stock Prices Technicians, in contrast, think that stock prices are determined by patterns. They believe that, by examining the pattern of past prices of a stock, they can predict (or at least make sensible statements about) the stock ’ s future prices. A technician may tell you that “we ’ re currently in a head-and-shoulders pattern,” by which he means that a graph of the stock price looks like the figure below: Lognormal Price Simulation Technical Analysis 202224262830323436 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 DayStock price ($)Head Shoulders Floor Other terms used by technicians include “floors” (there ’ s one in the graph), “rebound levels,” and “pennants.” The academic (some would say ivory tower) view of technical analysis is that it is worthless. A basic theory of financial theory says that markets effi-ciently incorporate the information known about the securities traded on them. There are several versions of this theory; one of them, the weak efficient markets hypothesis , says that at the very least all information about past prices is incorporated into the current price. The weak efficient markets hypothesis 694 Chapter 26 means that technical analysis cannot make predictions about futures prices, since technical analysis is based solely on past price information. 6 Nevertheless, a lot of people believe in technical analysis (this in itself may give technical analysis some validity). The simulations we are running in this chapter will allow us to generate a myriad of patterns which, when analyzed, will yield “good” predictions of future prices. For example, in the figure above it appears that $24 is a floor for the stock price, since it never goes any lower. A perspicacious analyst can detect a clear head-and-shoulders pattern between days 40 and 100. There appears to be a ceiling of $35. Thus a technician might predict that the stock price will stay below $37 unless it rises above that level. (If you are going to be a technician, you have to learn to say these things with a straight face.) 26.7 Calculating the Parameters of the Lognormal Distribution from Stock Prices The main purpose of this section is to show you how stock price data can be used to compute the annual mean return μ and the standard deviation of the annual return σ needed in the lognormal simulations (and—in Chapter 17—the σ needed as an input to the Black-Scholes formula). Before doing this, note that the mean and variance of the logarithm of the stock return over an interval Δ t are ES SEt Z t t S Stt t tt tln var ln+ +⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥=+⎡⎣⎤⎦= ⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ Δ ΔΔΔ Δμσ μ ⎡ ⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥=+ ⎡⎣⎤⎦= var μσ σΔΔ ΔtZ t t2 This means that both the expected log return and the variance of the log return are linear in time. Now suppose we want to estimate the lognormal μ and σ from data on historical prices. It follows that μσ=()⎡ ⎣⎤⎦= ()⎡⎣⎤⎦ ++ mean ln ,var lnS S tS S ttt ttt tΔΔ ΔΔ2 6. For a discussion of this point, see Chapter 13 of Brealey, Myers, and Allen (2005); for a more advanced treatment, see Chapters 10–11 of Copeland, Weston, and Shastri (2003). 695 Simulating Stock Prices To make things specific, the following spreadsheet gives monthly prices for a particular stock. From these prices we calculate the log returns and the annualized mean and standard deviation. Note that we have used the function Stdevp to calculate σ ; this assumes that the data represent the actual distribution. 1 2 345 6 7 8 9 10 1112 13 141516 17 1819AB C D Monthly average 1.23% <-- =AVERAGE(C10:C33) Monthly standard deviation 6.74% <-- =STDEV.S(C10:C33) Annual average, μ 14.76% <-- =12*C2 Annual standard deviation, σ 23.36% <-- =SQRT(12)*C3 DateClosing priceMonthly return 3-Oct-11 36.54 1-Nov-11 36.08 -1.27% <-- =LN(B10/B9) 1-Dec-11 33.84 -6.41% <-- =LN(B11/B10) 3-Jan-12 36.07 6.38% <-- =LN(B12/B11) 1-Feb-12 35.88 -0.53% <-- =LN(B13/B12) 1-Mar-12 32.63 -9.49% <-- =LN(B14/B13) 2-Apr-12 33.64 3.05% <-- =LN(B15/B14) 1-May-12 29.55 -12.96% 1-Jun-12 27.99 -5.42% 2-Jul-12 32.67 15.46% 1-Aug-12 32.39 -0.86%CALCULATING THE ANNUAL MEAN AND SIGMA OF RETURNS FROM MONTHLY PRICE DATA FOR HALLIBURTON CORPORATION Oct. 2011—Oct. 2013 Note that the annual average log return is 12 times the monthly average log return, whereas the annual standard deviation is 12 the monthly standard deviation. In general if the return data are generated for n periods per year, then mean n mean n annual return periodic return annual return per =⋅ = ⋅ ,σσ iiodic return Of course, this is not the only way to calculate the parameters of the log- normal distribution. We should mention at least two other methods: • We can use some other procedure to extrapolate the mean and standard deviation of future returns from the past history of returns. One example of this would be to use a moving average. 696 Chapter 26 • We can use the Black-Scholes formula to find the implied volatility : The σ of the stock ’ s log returns which fits the price of an option on the stock. This is illustrated in section 17.4. 26.8 Summary The lognormal distribution is one of the foundations of the Black-Scholes formula for option pricing discussed in the next chapter. In this chapter we have explored the meaning of lognormality for stock prices. We have shown how lognormality—the assumption that the returns on an asset are normally distributed—can be justified visually for the S&P 500 portfolio. We have also shown how to simulate price paths which are lognormally distributed. Finally, we have shown how to compute the mean and the standard deviation of a lognormal distribution from the historic returns of an asset. Exercises 1.

The exercise file for this chapter contains daily price data for the S&P 500 index and for Abbott Laboratories for the 3 months April–June 2007. Use these data to compute the annual average, variance, and standard deviation of the logarithmic returns for the S&P and for Abbott. What is the correlation between the returns of the S&P 500 and Abbott? 7. The exercise file for this chapter gives daily returns from 1987–2012 for the Vanguard Index 500 fund (VFINX). This is a fund that tracks the S&P 500, but the returns include dividends (as opposed to ∧ GSPC, the index tracker). • Compute the overall daily return statistics: average and standard deviation. • Annualize these statistics, assuming that there are 250 days per year. • Compute the daily and annualized return statistics by year. Hint: Take a look at the functions DAverage and DStdev discussed in Chapter 33. 1 2 345 6 7 89 10 11 12131415161718 19 2021G F E D C B A Initial stock price 20Mean return, m 12%Delta t 0.0833 <-- =1/12 MonthRandom numbe 20% 40% 80% r 0 20.0000 20.0000 20.0000 1 -1.10554 18.9519 17.7800 15.6492 <-- =E8*EXP($B$3*$B$4+$E$7*SQRT($B$4)*$B9)2 -0.82712 18.2497 16.3229 13.0580 <-- =E9*EXP($B$3*$B$4+$E$7*SQRT($B$4)*$B10) 3 -1.43142 16.9710 13.9752 9.4766 <-- =E10*EXP($B$3*$B$4+$E$7*SQRT($B$4)*$B11) 4 -1.02984 16.1521 12.5330 7.54595 0.966426 17.2506 14.1534 9.52756 -1.10249 16.3494 12.5869 7.46017 -0.41797 16.1200 12.1144 6.84188 0.707861 16.9612 13.2783 8.13789 -0.70316 16.4501 12.3658 6.9876 10 0.266112 16.8727 12.8798 7.5052 11 -1.04668 16.0429 11.5283 5.9528 12 -0.87832 15.4029 10.5211 4.9088Stock price with sigma =SIMULATING A LOGNORMAL PRICE PROCESS 0510152025 0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2Monthly prices for 3 sigmas 20% 40% 80% 2 7 Monte Carlo Simulations for Investments 27.1 Overview In this chapter we simulate the performance of portfolio investments of one or more stocks. We start with simulations of a single stock (a slight repetition of materials covered in the previous chapter). We then deal with correlation, first discussing the case of two correlated stock returns, and then generalizing to portfolios of multiple stocks, using the Cholesky decomposition (Chapter 24). We go on to discuss simulations of pension problems, where portfolio investment is used to finance future withdrawals. Finally we discuss the simu-lation of β , showing that low β stocks have higher α . Throughout this chapter we use the technique of running a Data Table on a blank cell to do sensitivity analysis. This technique, which enables us to run multiple random simulations, is described in Chapter 31. A Computational Note The spreadsheets for this chapter are very computationally intensive. We have dealt with this problem by splitting them up into separate Excel notebooks dealing with the various issues. We also advise turning off the automatic com-putation of Data Tables ( File|Options|Calculation options|Automatic except for data tables) . 27.2 Simulating Price and Returns for a Single Stock In this section we simulate portfolio investments. We start with an exercise we have already done in Chapter 26, namely, simulating stock returns over time. Suppose we start with one stock, and consider a possible future price path for 700 Chapter 27 this stock. In the spreadsheet below we simulate such a price path: At each point t , we generate a random return for the stock: rt t Zt=+μσΔΔ where Z is a standard normal deviate generated by Norm.S.Inv(rand( )) . 1 The stock price at time t is given by SS t t Ztt=+ ⎡⎣⎤⎦ −1exp μσΔΔ Below is a simulation example for monthly stock prices: 1 2 3456789 1011121314151617181920212223242526ABCDEFGH I Mean 12%Sigma 30%Delta_t 0.0833 <-- =1/12Initial pric e 12.00 Month Price 0 12.001 11.69 <-- =B8*EXP(Mean*Delta_t+Sigma *SQRT(Delta_t)*NORM.S.INV(RAND())) 2 10.51 <-- =B9*EXP(Mean*Delta_t+Sig ma*SQRT(Delta_t)*NORM.S.INV(RAND())) 39 . 9 74 11.825 14.056 14.427 13.408 11.509 10.27 10 11.5211 12.5912 15.46SIMULATING MONTHLY STOCK PRICE 678910111213141516 0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2SimulaƟng One Year of Stock Prices (Mean,Sigma) = (12.00%,30.00%) 1.

This means that the expected price at the end of n months is P n = P n exp[ μ ( n Δ t ) + σ 2 ( n Δ t )/2]. For 12 months (1 year), the expected price is P n = P n exp[ μ + σ 2 /2]. Of course you will never see exactly this expected price, but if you run the simulation many times, the average ending price will be approximately P n = P n exp[ μ + σ 2 /2]. We show this in the Data Table below: 702 Chapter 27 1 2 3456789 1011121314151617181920212223242526ABCDEFGH I J K L M Mean 12% Mean price 13.7851 <-- =AVERAGE(L10:L209) Sigma 30% Max 26.3859 <-- =MAX(L10:L34) Delta_t 0.0833 <-- =1/12 Min 5.5119 <-- =MIN(L10:L34) Initial pric e 12.00 Expected ending 14.1527 <-- =B5*EXP(Mean+Sigma^2/2) Month Price 0 12.001 12.11 <-- =B8*EXP(Mean*Delta_t+Sigma*SQRT(Delta_t)*NORM.S.INV(RAND())) 10.4890 <-- =B20, data table header 2 11.92 <-- =B9*EXP(Mean*Delta_t+Sigma*SQRT(Delta_t)*NORM.S.INV(RAND())) 1 15.8501 3 10.79 29 .6356 4 10.37 3 14.8198 5 11.20 49 .1409 6 11.45 5 11.1895 79 . 7 5 6 11.5435 89 . 7 1 7 14.1382 9 10.65 8 14.5613 10 9.82 91 3 . 7 2 5 7 11 9.38 10 16.7483 12 10.49 11 26.385912 16.814113 18.583714 8.6738 15 5.5119 16 16.523717 8.9945SIMULATING A SINGLE STOCK: PRICES 200 simulations of ending price 678910111213 0123456789 1 0 1 1 1 2SimulaƟng One Year of Stock Prices (Mean,Sigma) = (12.00%,30.00%) 2. Were we to increase the number of simulations to 200, the average (cell L2) would be closer to the expected (cell L5). A statistician would refer to this as a “small sample problem.” We prefer to note that 25 simulations of a series of annual returns is—in plain English—the simulation of 25 years of annual returns. This is a lot! Our interpretation: Finance is full of small sample prob-lems, despite the large amount of data available. We return to this topic in section 27.7, where we simulate stock betas. In the above example the Data Table simulates the ending price (cell B20). The average ending price for 25 simulations is close to the expected ending price (cell L5). 2 27.3 Portfolio of Two Stocks We extend the exercise of the previous section to two stocks with correlation ρ .

When we turn to multiple stocks, we need to make use of the Cholesky decomposition (see section 24.7). We remind you how the Cholesky decomposition works: We want to create a set of normal deviates that has variance-covariance struc-ture S : S N N NN N N=⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥σσ σ σσ σ σσ σ11 12 1 21 22 2 12 As explained in Chapter 24, the steps in doing this are as follows: 1. Create a lower-triangular Cholesky decomposition of S . We denote this matrix by L and use the VBA function Cholesky on the disk with this book to compute the matrix. 2. Create a column vector of N standard normal deviates. We use the Excel function Norm.S.Inv(Rand( )) . 3. Multiply L times the column vector of standard normal deviates. 4. The result is a set of correlated standard normal variates. Example: Standard Normal Deviates with Given Correlation Structure Here ’ s an example. We define a VBA function CorrNormal that takes as its argument the desired variance-covariance matrix. Below we use this function to simulate 3 years of monthly returns with means specified in cells B3:D3 and variance-covariance in the cells below the means. 709 Monte Carlo Simulations for Investments 1 2 3 4 5678 9 10 11 12 13 1415 16 17 18 19 20 2122 23 24 2526 27 28AB C D E FG H I J K Month % 5 6 . 9 3 1 % 0 0 . 1 % 0 0 . 2 % 0 0 . 3 % 0 0 . 4 -14.76% 7.37% -31.14% 2 35.08% 24.91% 48.30% 5.50% 3 59.32% -21.07% 55.70% 49.49% % 2 6 . 8 1 % 2 4 . 2 2 % 0 5 . 1 2 % 8 9 . 2 3 4 0 0 0 . 0 0 2 0 . 0 0 3 0 . 0 0 0 4 . 0 0.030 0.300 0.000 - % 1 8 . 1 6 % 6 6 . 1 2 % 8 4 . 8 0 1 5 0 6 0 . 0 -18.11% % 1 5 . 9 6 0 3 0 . 0 0 0 2 . 0 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 2 . 0 -61.34% -30.38% -8.12% 0.000 - % 9 9 . 8 1 % 4 9 . 7 2 7 0 0 1 . 0 0 3 0 . 0 0 6 0 . 0 -14.77% -7.86% 8 -111.90% 4.41% -45.30% 28.64%9 23.50% -23.32% 30.42% 16.33% Count 36 <-- 01 ) G : G ( T N U O C = -34.89% -19.63% 10.32% 33.48% 11 -6.82% 64.53% -103.76% -23.03%12 -85.11% -19.16% -84.99% -3.20% 0.0683 0.0089 0.0092 -0.0410 <-- =AVERAGE(J:J) 13 15.16% -4.81% -1.82% -9.40% 0.0400 0.0300 0.0200 0.0100 <-- Theore/g415cal mean 14 -106.19% 14.36% -84.03% -65.22% 15 82.83% 37.21% 31.91% -14.62% 16 26.93% -108.92% 18.73% 37.40% 0.3293 0.2128 0.1769 0.0643 <-- =VAR.S(J:J) 17 45.52% -22.53% 14.80% -8.79% 0.4000 0.3000 0.2000 0.1000 <-- Theore/g415cal variance 18 - 35.01% 78.25% -51.82% -42.48% 19 45.79% -34.86% 29.89% 22.20% 20 56.55% -6.03% -35.33% -29.66% 21 57.91% -40.91% 11.52% 26.60% 0.0799 0.0861 -0.1291 -0.0332 <-- {=A6:D9-varcovar(G:J)} 22 -9.86% 33.99% 0.02% -43.59% 3 2 5 4 0 0 . 0 5 0 6 0 . 0 1 3 9 0 . 0 1 6 8 0 . 0 -20.68% -13.32% 0.28% -10.90% 0.0509 0.0605 0.0280 - 42 4 5 1 0 . 0 -54.97% 58.29% 5.19% -42.82% -0.0332 0.0045 - %2 8 . 6 6 5 2 5 7 3 0 . 0 4 5 1 0 . 0 -5.66% 75.10% -2.78% 26 -107.69% 21.00% -11.28% -23.31%Sta/g415s/g415cs Data average vs theore/g415cal mean Data variance vs theore/g415cal variance Sample variance-covariance minus the variance-covariance matrixMonthly means <-- {=corrnormal($A$6:$D$9)+ $A$3:$D$3}NORMAL DEVIATES WITH DESIRED MEANS USING THE CHOLESKY DECOMPOSITION 3 years of simulated monthly data Variance-covariance matrix3 years of simulated monthly returns 1 2 3 4 5 6 789 10 1112 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2122 23 24 25 26 27AB C D E FG H I J K Month % 6 4 . 4 3 % 2 9 . 4 5 % 7 3 . 0 3 1 % 0 0 . 1 % 0 0 . 2 % 0 0 . 3 % 0 0 . 4 -31.99% 2 -39.31% -55.10% -19.66% 42.11% 3 -12.04% -106.92% 38.44% 33.99% 4 0 0 0 . 0 0 2 0 . 0 0 3 0 . 0 0 0 4 . 0 -26.48% -45.08% -23.79% 56.90% 0.030 0.300 0.000 - 5 0 6 0 . 0 -4.61% 14.74% 3.30% 23.00% % 7 9 . 3 7 6 0 3 0 . 0 0 0 2 . 0 0 0 0 . 0 0 0 2 . 0 -30.09% 50.34% -3.26% 0.000 - 7 0 0 1 . 0 0 3 0 . 0 0 6 0 . 0 -118.50% -97.71% -20.31% 7.28% 8- 1 8 . 9 6 % - 4 . 7 5 % - 3 9 . 3 5 % - 9 . 6 5 %9 -44.79% 195.97% 7.85% 13.42% Count 500 <-- %3 9 . 3 5 0 1 ) G : G ( T N U O C = -37.18% 12.84% -4.62% 11 -73.29% -7.69% -28.67% -40.54% 12 159.96% -23.86% 103.38% 50.33% 0.0261 -0.0077 0.0318 0.0138 <-- =AVERAGE(J:J) 13 111.39% -27.33% 64.59% 1.55% 0.0400 0.0300 0.0200 0.0100 <-- Theore/g415cal mean 14 21.98% 29.09% 38.99% 28.19% 15 -31.05% 14.37% 27.04% 22.06% 16 -30.86% 28.08% -8.95% 54.89% 0.3189 0.3375 0.1912 0.1034 <-- =VAR.S(J:J) 17 -43.76% 68.92% -7.72% -31.58% 0.4000 0.3000 0.2000 0.1000 <-- Theore/g415cal variance 18 -130.46% 60.87% -79.26% -58.12% 19 -46.48% 75.66% 25.41% 26.95%20 59.00% 42.60% -3.99% -0.27% 21 -6.62% 101.89% -36.76% -25.29% 0.0817 0.0379 -0.1485 -0.0129 <-- {=A6:D9-varcovar(G:J)} 22 23.67% 26.17% -1.09% -21.08% 0.0379 - 32 9 6 1 0 . 0 0 6 2 0 . 0 8 6 3 0 . 0 -23.83% -30.14% 42.18% 44.61% 0.0315 0.0260 0.0092 - 42 7 5 0 0 . 0 -53.00% 24.61% 9.55% 15.60% -0.0129 0.0169 -0.0057 - %2 4 . 5 5 2 2 3 0 0 . 0 -48.75% 7.17% 46.58%Data average vs theore/g415cal mean Data variance vs theore/g415cal variance Sample variance-covariance minus the variance-covariance matrixNORMAL DEVIATES WITH DESIRED MEANS USING THE CHOLESKY DECOMPOSITION 500 months of simulated monthly data Monthly 0 0 5 s n a e m months of simulated monthly returns <-- {=corrnormal($A$6:$D$9)+ $A$3:$D$3} Variance-covariance matrix Sta/g415s/g415cs If we rerun this simulation for 500 months, the simulation more closely corresponds to the priors: 710 Chapter 27 The VBA Function CorrNormal The VBA function that creates the correlated normal deviates is a combination of two functions. The second of these functions URandomlist creates a column vector of standard normal deviates. These deviates are then multiplied times the Cholesky matrix.

There we discussed the case of a potential pensioner who wants to save for 5 years in order to enable eight subsequent withdrawals of 30,000. The question we discussed in section 1.6 is the calibration of the annual deposit so that the pension fund (with accumulated 8% annual interest) would be completely depleted after 8 years. 711 Monte Carlo Simulations for Investments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 101112 13 1415 16 1718 19 20 21AB C D E F % 8 t s e r e t n I Annual deposit 29,386.55 Annual retirement withdrawal 30,000.00 =$B$2*(C7+B7) YearAccount balance, beginning of yearDeposit at beginning of yearInterest earned during yearTotal in account, end year 7 B + 7 C + 7 D = - - < 8 4 . 7 3 7 , 1 3 2 9 . 0 5 3 , 2 5 5 . 6 8 3 , 9 2 0 0 . 0 1 2 31,737.48 29,386.55 4,889.92 66,013.95 3 66,013.95 29,386.55 7,632.04 103,032.54 4 103,032.54 29,386.55 10,593.53 143,012.62 5 143,012.62 29,386.55 13,791.93 186,191.10 6 186,191.10 -30,000.00 12,495.29 168,686.39 7 168,686.39 -30,000.00 11,094.91 149,781.30 8 149,781.30 -30,000.00 9,582.50 129,363.81 9 129,363.81 -30,000.00 7,949.10 107,312.91 10 107,312.91 -30,000.00 6,185.03 83,497.94 11 83,497.94 -30,000.00 4,279.84 57,777.78 12 57,777.78 -30,000.00 2,222.22 30,000.00 13 30,000.00 -30,000.00 0.00 0.00A RETIREMENT PROBLEM, Section 1.6 Note : This problem has 5 deposits and 8 annual withdrawals, all made at the beginning of the year. The beginning of year 13 is the last year of the retirement plan; if the annual deposit is correctly computed, the balance at the beginning of year 13 after the withdrawal should be zero. Here ’ s the answer to this problem: In this section we discuss a Monte Carlo variation of this problem. As in Chapter 1, the future pensioner discovers that she has no pension savings and desires to make deposits to fund eight subsequent withdrawals. In this version, however, the savings are invested in a risky portfolio having mean return of 12% and return sigma of 18%. We are curious to see whether a specific level of annual deposits can fund the future planned withdrawals of 30,000 per year. To do this, we examine the bequest—the amount left in the pension plan at the end of year 13. Several things are clear: • Except for the case where 100% of the savings are invested in the risk-free asset, there is no longer any certainty about the savings or the bequest. • On average, the larger the proportion in the risky asset, the greater will be the average bequest. 712 Chapter 27 Here ’ s one simulation: 1 2 3456789 1011 12 13141516171819202122232425E D C B A f r : e m a n l l e C - - < % 8 e t a r e e r f - k s i R Risky asset n a e m : e m a n l l e C - - < % 2 1 n a e M a m g i s : e m a n l l e C - - < % 8 1 a m g i S Annual deposit 30,000 <-- Years 1-5 Investment policy p o r p : e m a n l l e C - - < % 0 3 e e r f - k s i R p o r p - 1 = - - < % 0 7 t e s s a y k s i R Annual retirement withdrawal 30,000 <-- Years 6-13 YearAccount balance, beginning of yearDeposit at beginning of yearIn account at end of year 9 4 6 , 1 3 0 0 0 , 0 3 0 1 2 31,649 30,000 69,767 3 69,767 30,000 97,717 4 97,717 30,000 139,754 5 139,754 30,000 158,609 6 158,609 -30,000 149,860 7 149,860 -30,000 131,279 8 131,279 -30,000 109,145 9 109,145 -30,000 94,169 10 94,169 -30,000 74,561 11 74,561 -30,000 57,691 12 57,691 -30,000 30,722 13 30,722 -30,000 692A RETIREMENT PROBLEM <-- =(B13+C13)*(prop*EXP(rf)+(1- prop)*EXP((mean+sigma*NORM.S.INV(RAND()) ))) 713 Monte Carlo Simulations for Investments 3 4567 8 9 1011 12 13 141516 17 18192021 22 23 24GH I Average 130,469 <-- =AVERAGE(H15:H24) Max 613,335 <-- =MAX(H15:H24) Min -36,264 <-- =MIN(H15:H24) Sigma 193,818 <-- =STDEV.S(H15:H24) % positive bequests 90% <-- =COUNTIF(H15:H24,\">0\")/10 Simulation Bequest 387,776 <-- =D25, data table header 1 613,335 2 79,823 3 41,689 4 3,386 5 67,000 6 319,044 7 94,766 8 59,295 9 -36,264 10 62,616Statistics for data table Data table: Simulating the bequest To get a feel for the uncertainty, we run our standard Data Table on a blank cell: The average bequest for this specific series of 10 simulations is 130,469 but with considerable variation.

We assume that we know the “actual” beta, in the sense that we know the σ M , σ i , and the correlation ρ between stock i and the market. We then simulate this beta by creating returns drawn from an appropriate distribution. We use this example to illustrate how far the actual beta, derived from data, can be from the theoretical beta. Recall from Chapter 11 that for an asset i , β ι is defined as follows: βiiM MCov r r Var r=() (), In the simulations below, we use two equivalent expressions for β ι . First, using the correlation ρ between i and M , we can write β ι as: βρσ σ σρσ σiiM MiM Mi MCov r r Var r=() ()==, 2 Second, if we have time-series data { r it , r Mt } for the returns on the stock and the market, then we can estimate β ι by running the regression: rrit i i Mt=+αβ If the data is correlated with correlation ρ , then we expect α ββρσ σρ iM i i ii MEr Er R=()− () ==,,22 In capital market calculations β ι is typically calculated for monthly returns over a period of 3 to 5 years. Below replicate this procedure by simulating the 60 correlated returns of two assets. We will call the first asset “ i ” and the second asset “ M .” We start with some basic data for i and M : 716 Chapter 27 1 2 345 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 151617 18 19 20 21 72 737475 76 777879 80 8182 83 8485AB C D E F Mean Sigma Stock i 6% 22% Market 10% 15% Correlation(i,M) 0.3000 Anticipated αi 0.0160 <-- =mu_i-B8*mu_m Anticipated βi 0.4400 <-- =rho*sigma_i/sigma_m Anticipated R20.0900 <-- =rho^2 Alpha 0.0086 <-- =INTERCEPT(E20:E79,F20:F79) Slope 0.4390 <-- =SLOPE(E20:E79,F20:F79) R-squared 0.0827 <-- =RSQ(E20:E79,F20:F79) Simulation s n r u t e R l a m r o N h t n o M Z1 Z2 Stock Market 1 0.6168 -1.4645 9.92% 3.66% 2 0.9019 1.1497 11.73% 14.98% 53 1.1386 -2.1888 13.23% 0.52% 54 -0.4403 1.0415 3.20% 14.51% 55 -1.5644 -1.4113 -3.94% 3.89% 56 1.2524 0.6107 13.95% 12.64% 57 1.3170 0.7016 14.36% 13.04% 58 -1.3743 -1.3212 -2.73% 4.28% 59 -2.2023 0.2114 -7.99% 10.92% 60 -0.1458 -1.1017 5.07% 5.23% Formulas Cell B20:=NORM.S.INV(RAND()) Cell C20:=rho*B20+SQRT(1-rho^2)*NORM.S.INV(RAND()) Cell E20:=mu_i+sigma_i*SQRT(1/12)*B20Cell F20:=mu_m+sigma_m*SQRT(1/12)*C20Regress r i on r MSIMULATING BETA AND ALPHA We now simulate our data: The formulas used in the spreadsheet: • Z 1 = Norm.S.Inv(Rand( )) .

The result is that the market and stock returns are correlated with correlation ρ . We now run a standard first-pass regress of r i on r M . For the simulations discussed above, the results of the Monte Carlo simulation are not far from the theoretical results: 718 Chapter 27 If we repeat our experiment 50 times, we see that the computed β ι exhibits considerable variability: 0.000.100.200.300.400.500.600.700.800.901.00 1 3 5 7 9 1 11 31 51 71 92 12 32 52 72 93 13 33 53 73 94 14 34 54 74 950 Simulated Betas Simulated beta Theore/g415cal beta Are Beta and Alpha Related? There is a growing literature showing that low beta stocks have high alphas and vice versa. 3 We show that this is true in our Monte Carlo simulation. In the spreadsheet below we run a Data Table showing beta and alpha as func- tions of σ i . 4 3.

In this chapter we examine some common cases of asset management: the return on a single stock, on a portfolio of risky assets with a given correlations structure, a standard savings/pension problem with an uncertain investment component, and the computation of asset betas. Exercises 1. Consider a portfolio of two stocks whose statistical parameters are given below. • Stock A: Annual mean return = 15%, annual standard deviation of return = 30%. • Stock B: μ = 8%, σ = 15%. • Correlation(A,B) = ρ = 0.3 721 Monte Carlo Simulations for Investments 2. Reconsider the problem above. Assume that the risk-free rate is 4% and that the investor (still buy-and-hold) invests in a portfolio composed of 50% risk-free and 50% invested in the 60/40 portfolio of A and B. Compare the theoretical to the simulated returns. 3. The previous example assumes that the risk-free rate is constant. An alternative, perhaps more plausible, model might be to assume that the risk-free rate is mean reverting, with a long-run mean. Under this assumption, if the current rate is above the long-run mean, the next period rate will tend downward, and vice versa. One such model is the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process: rr r t t Ztt t =+ − () + −− ↑11ϕμ σ ΔΔ Innovation in the rate/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext Simulate this process over 12 months: An investor with a buy-and-hold strategy buys a portfolio composed of 60% A and 40% B and holds it for 20 years.

Using the data from the previous example, simulate 36 months of stock returns assuming the same variance-covariance structure as the historical returns.

As one of our references states: “VaR answers the question: how much can I lose with x % probability over a pre-set horizon?” (J. P. Morgan, RiskMetrics—Technical Document 1 ). Another way of expressing this is that VaR is the lowest quantile of the potential losses that can occur within a given portfolio during a specified time period. The basic time period T and the confidence level (the quantile) q are the two major parameters that should be chosen in a way appropriate to the overall goal of risk measurement. The time horizon can differ from a few hours for an active trading desk to a year for a pension fund. When the primary goal is to satisfy external regulatory requirements, such as bank capital require-ments, the quantile is typically very small (e.g., 1% of worst outcomes). However, for an internal risk management model used by a company to control the risk exposure, the typical number is around 5% (visit the Internet sites in Selected References for more details). A general introduction to VaR can be found in Linsmeier and Pearson (1996) and in Jorion (1997). In the jargon of VaR, suppose that a portfolio manager has a daily VaR equal to $1 million at 1%. This statement means that there is only one chance in 100 that a daily loss bigger than $1 million occurs under normal market conditions. 28.2 A Really Simple Example Suppose a manager has a portfolio that consists of a single asset. The return of the asset is normally distributed with mean return 20% and standard devia-tion 30%. The value of the portfolio today is $100 million. We want to answer various simple questions about the end-of-year distribution of portfolio value: 1. What is the distribution of the end-of-year portfolio value? 2. What is the probability of a loss of more than $20 million by year-end (i.e., what is the probability that the end-of-year value is less than $80 million)? * This chapter is based on an article written with Zvi Wiener, “Value-at-Risk (VaR),” which first appeared in Mathematica in Education and Research 7 (1998). 1. This and other valuable documents produced by J. P. Morgan can be found on the disk that accompanies this book. 724 Chapter 28 3. With 1% probability, what is the maximum loss at the end of the year? This is the VaR at 1%. The probability that the end-of-year portfolio value is less than $80 million is about 9%: 1 2 34 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 1516 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27D C B A % 0 2 n a e M % 0 3 a m g i S Initial investment 100 0 8 f f o t u C Probability that portfolio worth less than cutoff 9.12% <-- =NORMDIST(B5,(1+B2)*B4,B4*B3,TRUE) Portfolio value 0.0055 0 0.0000 10 0.0000 20 0.0001 30 0.0001 40 0.0004 50 0.0009 60 0.0018 70 0.0033 80 0.0055 90 0.0081 100 0.0106 110 0.0126 120 0.0133 130 0.0126 140 0.0106 150 0.0081 160 0.0055Data table header: =NORMDIST(B5,(1+B2)*B4,B4*B3,FALSE)PROBABILITY OF YEAR-END PORTFOLIO VALUE 0.0000.0020.0040.0060.0080.0100.0120.014 0 2 55 07 5 1 0 0 1 2 5 1 5 0 1 7 5 2 0 0 2 2 5 2 5 0End-of-Year Portfolio Value Excel ’ s Norm.Dist function can return both the cumulative distribution and the probability mass function. 2 Here ’ s the way the screen looks when we apply the Norm.Dist function in cell B6: 2. In some versions of Excel this function appears without the dot as NormDist . 725 Value at Risk (VaR) The spreadsheet uses two versions of Norm.Dist : First we use the function in cell B6 to determine the probability that the year-end value of the portfolio is less than 80. In this version of the function, we use the value TRUE for the last entry in Norm.Dist ; when we write = NORMDIST(B5,(1 + B2)*B4,B4*B 3,TRUE), Norm.Dist returns values of the cumulative normal distribution. In the data table we set this value to FALSE to plot the probability mass function of the year-end portfolio value. 28.3 Defining Quantiles in Excel By using Excel ’ s Solver , we can determine that with a probability of 1%, the end-of-year portfolio value will be less than 50.209. Recall that the value at risk is the worst expected loss under normal market conditions over a specific time interval at a given confidence level. Therefore, the value 50.210 means that the VaR of the portfolio at the 1% level is 100 − 50.210 = 49.790. 726 Chapter 28 1 2 345 6 789 10111213141516171819AB C D E F G Mean 20% Sigma 30% Initial investment 100 Cutoff 50.210 Probability that portfolio worth less than cutoff 1.00% <-- =NORMDIST(B5 ,(1+B2)*B4,B4*B3,TRUE)PROBABILITY OF END-YEAR PORTFOLIO VALUE The cutoff is known as the quantile of the distribution. In Excel it can be determined by using Solver , as illustrated above. For two distributions we use—the normal and the lognormal distributions—Excel has built-in functions which find the quintile. These functions— Norm.Inv , Norm.S.Inv , and Loginv —find the inverse for the normal, standard normal, and lognormal distributions. Here ’ s an example for the numbers given above; this time we have written the function = NORM.INV(0.01,(1 + B3)*B5,B5*B4) in cell B6. This function finds the cutoff point for which the normal distribution with mean = 120 and standard deviation = 30 has probability of 1%. You can see this point on the graph below, which shows part of the cumulative distribution: 727 Value at Risk (VaR) The Lognormal Distribution The lognormal distribution is a more reasonable distribution for many asset prices (which cannot become negative) than the normal distribution. Suppose that the return [return = Log(price relative)] on the portfolio is normally dis- tributed with annual mean μ and annual standard deviation σ . Furthermore, suppose that the current value of the portfolio is given by V 0 . Then it follows (see Hull, 2011) that the logarithm of the portfolio value at time T , V T , is normally distributed. 3 This means: ln ~ ln , VN o r m a lV TTT() () +−⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥ 02 2μσσ 1 2 3456789 10111213141516171819202122232425AB C Mean 20% Sigma 30% Initial investment 100 Cutoff 50.210 <-- =NORMINV(0.01,(1+B2)*B4,B4*B3) 1.00% <-- =NORMDIST(B5 ,(1+B2)*B4,B4*B3,TRUE) VaR at 1.00% level 49.790 <-- =B5-B6CALCULATING THE QUANTILES 0.0%0.5%1.0%1.5%2.0%2.5%3.0% - 2 0 - 1 5 - 1 0- 5 0 5 1 01 52 02 53 03 54 04 55 05 56 06 5 Probability Portfolio value (million $)Cumulative Normal Distribution (only part--so we can see the 1% quantile) 1% quantile point 3.

Recall that T is measured in annual terms; if there are 250 business days in a year, then the daily VaR cor- responds to T = 1/250 (for many fixed income instruments, one should use 1/360, 1/365, or 1/365.25, depending on the market convention): 28.4 A Three-Asset Problem: The Importance of the Variance-Covariance Matrix As can be seen from the preceding examples, VaR is not—in principle, at least—a very complicated concept. In the implementation of VaR, however, there are two big practical problems (both problems are discussed in much 729 Value at Risk (VaR) greater detail in the material available on the RiskMetrics website, www.msci. com/resources/ ): 1. The first problem is the estimation of the parameters of asset return distri- butions. In “real world” applications of VaR, it is necessary to estimate means, variances, and correlations of returns. This is a not-inconsiderable problem! In this section we illustrate the importance of the correlations between asset returns. In the following section we give a highly simplified example of the estimation of return distributions from market data. For example, you can imagine that a long position in euros and a short position in U.S. dollars are less risky than a position in only one of the currencies, because of a high probability that profits of one position will be mainly offset by losses of another. 2. The second problem is the actual calculation of position sizes. A large financial institution may have thousands of loans outstanding. The database of these loans may not classify them by their riskiness, nor even by their term to maturity. Or—to give a second example—a bank may have offsetting posi-tions in foreign currencies at different branches in different locations. A long position in euros in New York may be offset by a short position in euros in Geneva; the bank ’ s risk—which we intend to measure by VaR—is based on the net position. We start with the problem of correlations between asset returns. We continue the previous example, but assume that there are three risky assets. As before, the parameters of the distributions of the asset returns are known: all the means, μ 1 , μ 2 , μ 3 , as well as the variance-covariance matrix of the returns: S=⎛ ⎝⎜ ⎜⎞ ⎠⎟ ⎟σσσ σσσ σσσ11 12 13 21 22 23 31 32 33 The matrix S is of course symmetric; σ ii is the variance of the i th asset ’ s return, and σ ij is the covariance of the returns of assets i and j (if i = j , σ ij is the vari- ance of asset i ’ s return). Suppose that the total portfolio value today is $100 million, with $30 million invested in asset 1, $25 million in asset 2, and $45 million in asset 3. Then the return distribution of the portfolio is given by: Mean return x x x Variance of return x x x S x=++ ={}11 22 33 123 1μμμ ,, . . , xxxT 23, {} 730 Chapter 28 where x = { x 1 , x 2 , x 3 } = {0.3, 0.25, 0.45} is the vector of proportions invested in each of the three assets. Assuming that the returns are normally distributed (meaning that prices are lognormally distributed), we may calculate the VaR as in the following spreadsheet: 1 2 3456789 1011121314151617 18AB C D E F G H Mean returnsPortfolio proportions Asset 1 10% 0.10 0.04 0.03 0.30 Asset 2 12% 0.04 0.20 -0.04 0.25 Asset 3 13% 0.03 -0.04 0.60 0.45 Initial investment 100 Mean return 0.1185 <-- {=MMULT(TRANSPOSE(B3:B5),H3:H5)} Portfolio sigma 0.3848 <-- {=SQRT(MMULT (MMULT(TRANSPOSE(H3:H5),D3:F5),H3:H5))} Mean investment value 111.8500 Sigma of investment value 38.4838 Cutoff 22.3234 <-- =NORMINV(0.01,(1+B8)*B7,B9*B7) Cumulative PDF 0.01 <-- =NORMDIST(B14,B11,B12,TRUE) VaR at 1.00% level 77.6766 <-- =B7-B14VaR FOR 3 ASSET PROBLEM Variance-covariance matrix Note that the functions in cells B8 and B9 are array functions: You must press [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[Enter] after you write the function in the cell.

We suppose that the current date is 10 February 1997, and we consider a firm which has an investment in two assets: • It is long two units of an index fund. The fund ’ s current market price is 293, so that the investment in the index fund is worth 2 * 293 = 586. • It is short a foreign bond denominated in rubles. The bond is a zero-coupon bond (i.e., pays no interest), has face value of 100 rubles and maturity of 8 May 2000. If the current ruble interest rate is 5.30%, then the 10 February 1997 ruble value of the bond is −∗ − ∗ − () [] =− 100 5 30 8 2000 10 1997 365 84 2166 exp . % , . , .

We illustrate one technique for doing this which is called “bootstrapping”: This refers to random reshufflings of the data. For each iteration, we reorder the series of index prices, interest rates, and exchange rates and calculate the return on the portfolio. 4 4. The bootstrapping technique is illustrated in the appendix to this chapter. 733 Value at Risk (VaR) The distribution of the bootstrapped return data looks like this: 1 23 4 5 6 789 101112131415 16 171819202122232425262728 29 30313233JK L M NO P Q R S Max return 1.16080 <-- =MAX(J:J) =K3 Min return -0.53821 <-- =MIN(J:J) =($K$2-$K$3)/50+L7 Output BinsCumulative percent 0.2859 -0.5382 1 0.0% -0.1820 -0.5042 57 1.1% 0.0954 -0.4703 76 1.5% 0.4311 -0.4363 95 1.9% -0.0504 -0.4023 133 2.7% 0.1755 -0.3683 217 4.3% 0.0008 -0.3343 218 4.4% -0.2790 -0.3004 150 3.0% -0.3847 -0.2664 138 2.8% -0.3961 -0.2324 165 3.3% -0.1576 -0.1984 155 3.1% 0.0378 -0.1644 158 3.2% 0.5969 -0.1305 158 3.2% 0.2791 -0.0965 142 2.8% -0.3907 -0.0625 181 3.6% 0.5339 -0.0285 259 5.2% -0.0546 0.0055 239 4.8% -0.3956 0.0395 291 5.8% -0.4083 0.0734 216 4.3% 0.0810 0.1074 133 2.7% 0.2932 0.1414 139 2.8% 0.1866 0.1754 97 1.9% -0.0121 0.2094 117 2.3% -0.3674 0.2433 99 2.0% -0.2599 0.2773 100 2.0% -0.4493 0.3113 103 2.1% 0.1674 0.3453 85 1.7%Bootstrapped Return Frequency Distribution 5,000 Iterations 050100150200250300350 -1.0000 -0.5000 0.0000 0.5000 1.0000 1.5000Frequency ReturnBootstrapped Return Frequency Distribution 5,000 Iterations The graph indicates the return distribution, which is far from normal. From columns L, M, and N, you can tell that the 1% VaR is about − 50%, meaning, with a probability of 1%, the firm could lose 50% of its investment. How Did We Produce the Bootstrapped Data? Bootstrapping basically consists of reshuffling the data randomly, and then viewing each reshuffle as a point in a distribution. In the spreadsheet on 734 Chapter 28 page 732, the columns C, E, and G contain random numbers. The VBA program below contains three For loops which insert three columns of random numbers into the spreadsheet. On the spreadsheet for this chapter, this program can be run through the shortcut [Ctrl] + a. Having inserted the random numbers, the spreadsheet then uses Excel ’ s Sort function to sort the index prices (column B), the foreign interest rates (column D), and the exchange rate (column F). This produces random combinations of the three portfolio pricing factors, which give the resulting portfolio values in column H and the portfolio return in cell F3. ‘My thanks to Marek Jochec for cleaning ‘up this code!

Notice that this simulation takes a very long time! On the author ’ s laptop 5,000 simu-lations took almost 17 minutes. Monte Carlo Simulations In this section we return to the three-asset problem discussed in section 28.5. Instead of doing statistical analysis, we run a simulated set of returns. In the spreadsheet below, we simulate (columns G–J) 30 days of daily returns on a portfolio of three assets. The annual mean returns of the assets are very pes-simistic (A3:C3). For the portfolio (25%, 50%, 25%) the cumulative 30-day simulated return for the specific simulation is − 5.40% (cells B19 and J34).

It is based on the “birthday bingo” game created for Helen Benninga ’ s 85th birthday. The game goes like this: 737 Value at Risk (VaR) • Everyone gets a “Helen Bingo Card,” which has five columns of five numbers each. The first column has five numbers from 1 to 17, the second column has five numbers between 18 and 34, and so on. So a typical card looks like this: HELEN 3 2 35 15 27 5 15 26 40 57 70 9 2 15 06 88 2 7 2 24 95 67 18 2 04 55 56 9Helen's bingo game!!!85th Birthday • We made up 85 questions with answers from 1 to 85. When a card with a question was drawn, someone had to give the correct answer, and then every-one who had the number on his or her card could cross it out. For example, if we asked, “How many grandchildren does Helen have?” and someone answered “13,” then everyone with a 13 in the first column could cross it out. • The first person with five numbers in a line (a column, a row, or a diagonal) won the prize. (Note that it didn ’ t take any talent to win—all you had to do was hear the right answers.) We wanted to use Excel to create the cards, but it wasn ’ t initially clear how to go about this. Finally, the requisite trick, which is that we want to model the selection of balls from an urn without replacement, was discovered. (We will discuss this topic in greater detail later.) The Trick The trick is very simple. As an illustration, suppose we want to make a random draw of five numbers between 1 and 17 (these will be the five numbers that will appear in the first column of a particular Helen Bingo card). Here ’ s how we go about this: • First create a list of numbers from 1 to 17 and an adjoining column of random numbers. This will give something that looks like the following: 738 Chapter 28 1 2345678 9 10 1112131415 16 1718AB 1 0.6531522 0.4258763 0.7431734 0.9117095 0.1043566 0.092287 0.49608 8 0.210725 9 0.740506 10 0.72437611 0.31017512 0.43722513 0.19722414 0.145462 15 0.797405 16 0.5216617 0.438188 EXPLAINING THE TRICK The list of numbers was itself created in two stages: In the first stage = Rand( ) was entered into each of the cells B2:B18. In the second stage B2:B18 were copied and were then pasted special back into their locations using Edit|Paste Special|Values . This procedure gets rid of the formulas behind the numbers (else Rand( ) will change its values every time we hit [Enter]). • Next, sort both columns using the second column as a sorting key. To do this, first mark off the relevant data, and then use the Excel command Data|Sort . This will bring up the following screen, in which I ’ ve chosen to sort the data by Column C. 739 Value at Risk (VaR) 1 2345678 9 10 1112131415 16 1718AB 1 0.041996 16 0.057147 7 0.089137 17 0.18458 9 0.1858164 0.2019753 0.231535 11 0.49365810 0.58846 6 0.609492 0.638563 14 0.667014 5 0.678208 13 0.683465 8 0.762878 15 0.81515812 0.924981EXPLAINING THE TRICK • In this case, the Sort command will give: 740 Chapter 28 • Finally, pick the first five numbers from the first column (in this example: 1, 16, 7, 17, 9). You could, of course, equally well pick the last five, the middle five, or any other five numbers from the column. The Probabilistic Model What we ’ re doing here is just like picking random numbers out of an urn without replacement . This model, standard in all introductory probability books, imagines an urn filled with balls. Each ball has a different number—in our case, there are 17 balls with numbers between 1 and 17. The urn is shaken to mix up the balls, and then five balls are drawn out. Each ball, once drawn, is not placed back in the urn. This is somewhat different from the standard random number generators, which pick random numbers with replacement (i.e., once the ball ’ s number is recorded, it is placed back in the urn, so that it could possibly be drawn again). 5 Writing a VBA Program The next obvious step was to write a program in VBA to automate the proce-dure. The spreadsheet is given below. 5. Excel has a function Randbetween(low,high) which lets you create random integers between low and high . Thus, to create five numbers between 1 and 17, you just copy = Randbetween(1,17) into five adjacent cells. However, this is like drawing numbers from the urn with replacement, and hence can give you multiple draws of the same number—and this is a bingo no-no! 741 Value at Risk (VaR) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11BC D E F G H I HELEN 2 2 04 76 37 3 15 18 39 68 78 5 3 14 35 88 0 11 19 44 65 69 17 26 51 64 76Helen's 85th Birthday bingo game!!!Ctrl + b runs the macro The code which produced this spreadsheet is given below. 6 6. I thank Paul Legerer for vastly improving the code for this program from the previous edition of Financial Modeling . An astute reader will note that Paul ’ s program internalizes the sorting of the random numbers in the VBA code, so that only the printing of the card is done in the spreadsheet.

We start by showing how an option on a stock can be replicated by a dynamic portfolio of the stock and a bond. We go on to apply this approach to portfolio insurance (a combi-nation of a put and stock) and to a butterfly. Our approach has its roots in the Black-Scholes formula. This formula can be interpreted as showing that an option is a portfolio of a position in the underlying asset and a position in the risk-free asset, where both positions are adjusted dynamically over time. Remarkably, the Black-Scholes formula shows that if the adjustment process is continuous, then the dynamic strategy is self-financing: It requires no addi-tional cash flows after the establishment of the initial portfolio. In a more realistic situation it is of course impossible to replicate the option strategy portfolio continuously. We have to compromise by making only peri-odic adjustments, and this forces us to consider first how to define the strategy over time, and second how well the compromise strategy performs in replicat-ing the option strategy. We will show several approaches to this problem. Background: Price Simulations and the Black-Scholes Formula Recall from Chapter 26 that the way to simulate a stock price is to simulate SS t t Ztt=∗ + ⎡⎣⎤⎦ −1exp μσΔΔ , where Z is a draw from a standard normal distribution. In Excel this formula becomes: 1 SS t ttt=∗ + ∗ () () ⎡⎣⎤⎦ −1exp . . μσΔΔ Norm S Inv Rand We will use this formula throughout the chapter to simulate stock prices. Recall also that the Black-Scholes formula, explained in Chapter 17, states that the prices of a European call and put are given by: Call SN d Xe N d P u t S Nd X eNd dSXrrT rT= ()− () =− − () +− () =()++− −12 12 1ln σ σ σσ2 212 ()=−T Tdd T, 1. The Excel function Norm.S.Inv is equivalent to the older version, Normsinv . Both functions are part of the newer Excel editions. 746 Chapter 29 In this chapter our interpretation of this formula is that an option can be replicated by a long or short position in the underlying stock and a long or short position in the risk-free asset (jargon: “the bond”): Stock position Bond position Call SN d Xe N drT= () − ()−1 2 SN dt 1() Long position in stock − ()−−()Xe N dtTt* 2 Short position in bond Put SN d Xe N drT=− − () +− ()−1 2 −− () SN dt 1 Short position in stock Xe N dtTt−−()−()* 2 Long position in bond It follows that if we replicate an option with a portfolio of stocks and bonds, this portfolio needs to be rebalanced often. A remarkable fact, proved by Black and Scholes in their pathbreaking 1973 paper, is that if the rebalancing is continuous, then the changes in the stock and bond positions exactly offset each other. This zero-investment property is also termed “self-financing” and is a hallmark of the Black-Scholes replicating portfolio. While we cannot prove this fact, we can give some intuition. In the spread- sheet below, we look at two very close times. At time t = 0, we price a call option on a stock whose current price is S 0 = 50. The option has exercise price X = 50, and expires at T = 0.5. The replicating portfolio for the option is 28.9698 in the stock and –24.2745 in the bond, giving a call option value of 4.6952 (cell B19). At time Δ t = 1/250 (roughly 1 day later), a randomly generated stock price is 49.8708. The replicating portfolio is now 28.6400 in the stock and –24.0399 in the bond. To compute the investment required to reach this portfolio, we have to revalue the previous investments in the stock and the bond. The previous stock position has grown in value to 28 969849 8708 5028 8949 ... ∗= and the previous bond position now has value of −∗ = −24 2745 24 2784.. ert*Δ (1 day ’ s interest has been added). This means that we must sell off some of the stock: (28.6400 − 28.8949) = 0.2548. Thus the cash flow from the change in the stock position is positive. In the bond position we want to change the debt from − 24.2784 to − 24.0399; this means that we require cash of 0.2385 to pay off some of the debt. The net cash flow from these changes is + 0.2549 − 0.2386 = 0.0163. In a spreadsheet: 747 Simulating Options and Option Strategies The Excel notebook with this chapter gives a dynamic spreadsheet for the above example that changes values with each press of F9 . Using this spread- sheet you can confirm: • The position changes rarely completely net out. • The smaller the Δ t , the smaller the net cash flow will be from the position change. Black-Scholes proved that in the limit, this net cash flow is always zero, and that the strategy is thus completely self-financing. 29.2 Imperfect but Cashless Replication of a Call Option To perfectly replicate a call option using the Black-Scholes formula will require continuous trading. Suppose we compromise a bit on strictly following the BS formula. In what follows we use the strategy of replication, but force it to be self-financing. We do this as follows: • At time 0, we set the initial portfolio equal to that prescribed by the BS formula: Stock = S 0 N ( d 1 ), Bond = − Xe − rT N ( d 2 ) 1 2 345 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24AB CDE F G t 0.0040 <-- =1/250 Time = 0 Time = t 8 0 7 8 . 9 4 0 0 0 0 . 0 5 S 0 0 0 0 . 0 5 0 0 0 0 . 0 5 X % 0 0 . 4 % 0 0 . 4 r T, time to option maturity 0.5000 0.4960 <-- =B8-B2 % 0 3 % 0 3 a m g i S d1 0.2003 0.1873 =E18-C18 d2 -0.0118 -0.0240 N(d 1) 0.5794 0.5743 7 1 C - 7 1 E = 5 B / 5 C * 7 1 B = N(d 2) 0.4953 0.4904 Stock position, S*N(d1) 28.9698 28.6401 <-- =C5*C14 28.8949 0.2548 <-- stock Bond position, -X*N(d2) -24.2745 -24.0399 <-- =-C6*EXP(-C8*C7)*C15 -24.2784 -0.2385 <-- bond Value of call option 4.6952 4.6002 3 6 1 0 . 0 ) 8 1 C : 7 1 C ( M U S = - - < =B18*EXP(B7*B2)BLACK-SCHOLES AS A PORTFOLIO Cash flow from position changeValue of previous position =SUM(F17:F18) net cash flow from position changeΔ ΔΔΔ 748 Chapter 29 • At times t > 0, we set the stock position = S t N ( d 1 ), but we set the bond posi- tion equal to the cash flow from the change in the stock position: Bond Bond e tt trt tt t+ ↑ +=∗ +ΔΔ Δ value of time bond position/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketextSSN dS Stttt t tt t1,() ∗+ ↑ +Δ Δ value of time stock position/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext /dncurlybracketright /horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext /horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext− () =++ ↑ +SN d Bondtt tt tt tΔΔ Δ1, desired stock position ∗∗+ () −() {}++ e S Nd Ndrt tt t ttΔ ΔΔ 11,, Here ’ s the way this looks.

As we showed in our discussion of option strategies in Chapter 15, when you purchase a stock (or a portfolio of stocks) and simultaneously purchase a put on the stock (on the portfolio), you are assured that the strategy payoff will never be lower than the exercise price on the put: 751 Simulating Options and Option Strategies Stock Put S X S SS X XS XTT TT T+= + − () => ≤⎧⎨⎩max , 0 if if It is not always possible to find marketed puts in all portfolios; in this case the Black-Scholes option pricing formula can show us how to replicate a put by a dynamic strategy in which the investment in a risky asset (be it a single stock or a portfolio) and the investment in riskless bonds changes over time to mimic the returns of a put option. Such replication strategies are at the heart of the portfolio insurance strategies discussed here. We start by considering the following simple example: You decide to invest in one share of General Pills stock, which currently costs $56. The stock pays no dividends. You hope for a large capital gain at the end of the year, but you worry that the stock ’ s price may decline. To guard against a decline in the stock ’ s price, you decide to purchase a European put on the stock. The put you purchase allows you to sell the stock at the end of 1 year for $50. The cost of the put, $2.38, is derived from the Black-Scholes model (see Chapter 17) using the following data: S 0 = $56, X = $50, σ = 30%, and r = 8%: 2 3 45 6 7AB C D E S0 56.00 0 0 . 0 5 X 1 T % 0 0 . 8 r Sigma 30% Put price 2.38 <-- =bsput(B2,B3,B4,B5,B6) This protective put or portfolio insurance strategy guarantees that you will lose no more than $6 on your share of General Pills stock. If the stock ’ s price at the end of the year is more than $50, you will simply let the put expire without exercising it. However, if the stock ’ s price at the end of the year is less than $50, you will exercise the put and collect $50. It is as if you had purchased an insurance policy on the stock with a $6 deductible. Of course this protection doesn ’ t come for free: Instead of investing $56 in your single share of stock, you have invested $58.38. You could have deposited the additional $2.38 in the bank and earned interest of 8%*$2.38 = $0.19 in the course of the year; alternatively, you could have used the $2.38 to buy more shares. 752 Chapter 29 To see how this strategy works, we perform sensitivity analysis of the strat- egy profit as a function of the terminal price of the stock S T : 9 10 11121314 15 16 1718192021 22 23 24252627282930313233343536373839AB C D E F G H I J Buy stock 56.00 <-- =B2 Buy put 2.38 <-- =B7 Total cost 58.38 <-- =B10+B11 ST 35.00 Put payoff 15.00 <-- =MAX(B3-B15,0) Total payoff 50.00 <-- =SUM(B15:B16) Profit -8.38 <-- =B17-B12 ST Stock Put Profit <-- =B23+C23-B12, data table headers (hidden) 00 50-8.37698 10 10 40 -8.37698 20 20 30 -8.37698 30 30 20 -8.37698 40 40 10 -8.37698 50 50 0 -8.37698 60 60 0 1.623024 70 70 0 11.62302 80 80 0 21.62302 90 90 0 31.62302 100 100 0 41.62302Payoff at date TPORTFOLIO INSURANCE STRATEGY Data table: Total strategy profit as function of ST -1001020304050 0 20 40 60 80 100 120Payoﬀs: Stock, Put, Total STProtecƟve Put on GP , Terminal Payo ﬀ Stock Put Proﬁt Portfolio Insurance When There Are No Traded Puts In the example above, we have implemented a portfolio insurance strategy by purchasing a put whose underlying asset exactly corresponds to our share portfolio. But this technique may not always be possible: • It could be that there is no traded put option on the shares we wish to insure. • It could also be that we want to purchase portfolio insurance on a more complicated basket of assets, such as a portfolio of shares. Puts on portfolios do exist (for example, there are traded puts on the S&P 100 and S&P 500 portfolios), but there are no traded puts on most portfolios. 753 Simulating Options and Option Strategies It is here that the Black-Scholes option pricing model comes to our aid. From this formula it follows that a put option on a stock (from here on, “stock” will be used to refer to a portfolio of stocks as well as a single stock) is simply a portfolio consisting of a short position in the stock and a long position in the risk-free asset, with both positions being adjusted continuously. For example, consider the Black-Scholes formula for a put with expiration date T = 1 and exercise price X . At time t , 0 ≤ t < 1, the put has value P S Nd X e Nd dS Xrt tdttrt t=− − () +− () =() ++() −() −−−() 11 2 1221 1ln / ,σ σ221 1 1=− − −dt t Stσ where is time remaining to maturity is the pri ice of the stock at time t Thus, buying a put is equivalent to investing Xe − r (1 − t ) N ( − d 2 ) in a risk-free bond which matures at time 1 and investing − S t N ( − d 1 ) in the stock. Since the invest- ment in the stock is negative, this means that a put is equivalent to a short position in the stock and a long position in the risk-free asset. The total investment required to buy one share of the stock plus a put on the stock is S t + P t . Writing this out and substituting in the Black-Scholes put formula gives Total investmen t protective put S P SS Nd X e Ntt ttrt, =+ =− − () +−−() 11− −() =− − () () +− () = ()+− (−−() −−()d SN dX eN d SN d X e N dtrt trt2 11 2 11 21 ) ) where the last equality uses the fact that for the standard normal distribution N ( x ) + N ( − x ) = 1. Another way of looking at this problem is to regard the total investment S t + P t at time t as a portfolio of a stock and a bond; we can then ask, What is the proportion ω t of this portfolio invested in the stock at time t ? Rewriting the formula above in terms of portfolio proportions gives 754 Chapter 29 Proportion invested in stock SN d SN d X e N dt t trt= =() ()+− (−−()ω 1 11 2) ) =− =−()−−()Proportion inv ested in risk free asset Xe N d St rt t1 1 2ω NNd X e N drt 11 2 ()+− ()−−() To sum up: If you want to buy a specific portfolio of assets and an insurance policy guaranteeing that at t = 1 your total investment will not be worth less than X , then at each point in time, t , you should invest a proportion ω t of your wealth in the specific portfolio you have chosen, and a proportion 1 − ω t in riskless, pure discount bonds that mature at t = 1. The Black-Scholes put pricing formula can be used to determine these proportions. An Example Suppose you decide to invest $1,000 in General Pills stock (currently selling at $56) and in protective puts on the shares with an exercise price of $50 and an expiration date 1 year from now. This ensures that your dollar value per share at the end of 1 year will be no less than $50. Suppose that there is no traded put on General Pills, so that you will have to create your own put by investing in the share and in riskless discount bonds. The riskless rate of inter-est is 8%, and the standard deviation of General Pills’ log return is 30%. We will construct a series of portfolios which implements this strategy on a week-by-week basis. Based on our discussion from the previous section, we know that this replication strategy will not be perfect. We simulate it to see how it works. Week 0 : At the beginning of this week, the initial investment in shares of General Pills should be: ω001 0056 0 7865 56 2 3875 45 =() +=∗ +=SN d SP. ..% 755 Simulating Options and Option Strategies with the remaining proportion, 1 − ω 0 = 24.55%, invested in riskless discount bonds maturing in 1 year. If traded European puts on GP existed and if these puts had an exercise price of 50 with an exercise date 1 year from now, these would be trading at $2.38. Your strategy would consist of buying 17.13 shares of GP (cost = $959.23) and 17.13 puts (cost = $40.77). Buying $754.40 worth of shares and $245.60 worth of bonds exactly duplicates the initial investment in 17.13 shares and 17.13 puts. This equivalence is guaranteed by Black and Scholes.

Three important properties are the following: PROPERTY 1 When the stock price is above the exercise price X , then the proportion ω invested in the risky asset is greater than 50%. Proof The proof of this property requires a little manipulation of our formula for ω . Rewrite ω as: ω=() ()+− ()= +−() ()−−() −−()SN d SN d Xe N d Xe N d SN drt rt1 11 21 2 11 1 We will show that when S ≥ X , the denominator of ω is < 2, which will prove the proposition: First note that when S ≥ X , X/S ≤ 1. Next note that e − r (1- t ) < 1 for all 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Finally, examine the expression 759 Simulating Options and Option Strategies Nd NdNt d Nd Nt S X r t t−() ()=−−( ) () =−− () +− [] −(2 11 11 05 1 1 1σ σσ.l n ( ) / ) ) ( ) −+ () +− [] −() ( )< Nt S X r t t05 1 1 11 .l n ( ) /σσ This proves the property. PROPERTY 2 When the stock ’ s price increases the proportion ω invested in the stock increases and vice versa. Proof To see this property, it is enough to see that when S increases, the value of the put decreases and N (- d 1 ) decreases. Rewrite the original definition of ω as: ω=−−() [] +=−−() [] +SN d SPNd PS11 111 / Thus, when S increases, the denominator of ω decreases and the numerator increases, which proves Property 2. PROPERTY 3 As t → 1, one of two things happens: If S t > X , then ω t → 1. If S t < X , then ω t → 0. Proof To see this, note that when S t > X and t → 1, N(d 1 ) → 1 and N(-d 1 ) → 0; thus for this case ω t → 1. Conversely, when S t < X and t → 1, N(d 1 ) → 0 and N(-d 1 ) → 1 and thus ω t → 0. (Strictly speaking these statements are only true as “probability limits”—see Billingsley 1968. What about the case when, as t → 1, S t /X → 1? In this case ω t → ½. However, the probability of this occurring is zero.) 29.5 Digression: Insuring Total Portfolio Returns We digress slightly to consider an interesting portfolio insurance problem. So far we have considered only the problem of constructing artificial puts, one 760 Chapter 29 per share. A slightly different version of this problem involves constructing a portfolio of puts and shares that guarantees the total dollar returns on the total initial investment. A typical story goes like this: You have $1,000 to invest, and you want to guarantee that a year from now you will have at least $1,000 z . Here z is some number, generally between 0 and 1; for example, if z = 0.93, this means that you want your final wealth to be at least $930. 2 You want to invest in a stock whose current price is S 0 and in a put on the stock with an exercise price X . You want the number of puts to be equal to the number of shares, so that each “package” of share + put costs you S 0 + P ( S 0 , X ). To implement the strategy, you must therefore buy α shares, where: α=+()1 000 00, , SP S X Since you have bought α shares and α puts with an exercise price of X , the minimum dollar return from your portfolio is α X . You want this to be equal to 1,000 z , and therefore you solve to get α = 1,000 z/X . Thus you can guarantee your minimum return if SP S X X z00+() = ,/ Here ’ s a spreadsheet implementation of this equation. The data table shows the graph of S 0 + P ( S 0 , X ) − X / z ; where this graph crosses the x-axis is the solution for the put exercise price X when S 0 = 56, σ = 30%, r = 6%, T = 1, and z = 93%. 2. As we show below, it is possible to insure (up to a point) even with z > 1. 761 Simulating Options and Option Strategies As you can see, the X for which the equation in cell B12 equals zero is between 56 and 57.

The minimum return of this portfolio is 16.4817* X = $930 (cell B19). Can You Insure for More Than Your Initial Investment? When we raise the insurance level, the implied exercise price of the put must go up. This means that as we buy more insurance, we spend relatively more of our $1,000 on puts (insurance) and relatively less on the stocks (which have the upside potential). Can we insure for more than our current level of investment? To put it another way, can we set z > 1? This means that we are picking an insurance level which guarantees that we end up with more than our initial investment. A little thought and some calculations reveal that we can indeed choose z > 1 as long as z ≤ 1 + r . That is: We cannot guarantee ourselves a return greater than the riskless interest rate! To see this, we offer two examples. In the first example below, we solve for z = 1.08 = 1 + r .

Recall from Chapter 15 that a butterfly consists of three options. In this section we simulate a butterfly over 1 month (22 days), rebalancing the position daily. Our butterfly consists of three calls written on a stock with current price S 0 = 35. We assume that the stock return is lognormal with σ = 35% and that r = 2%. The calls: • Call 1: X = 20, position: 1 call purchased • Call 2: X = 35, position: 2 calls written • Call 3: X = 50, position: 1 call purchased The payoff/profit pattern of the butterfly is described below: 766 Chapter 29 We recall the Black-Scholes formula and denoting the time remaining to option maturity by t : 1 2 3 456789 10111213 14 15 16171819 20 21 22 23242526272829303132333435363738ABCDEFGH S0 35 T 0.087302 <-- =22/252Sigma 80%r2 % XP o s i t i o n C o s t Call1 20 1 15.05 <-- =bscall($B$2,B8,$B$3,$B$5,$B$4) Call2 35 -2 3.32 <-- =bscall($B$2,B9,$B$3,$B$5,$B$4) Call3 50 1 0.29 <-- =bscall($B$2,B10,$B$3,$B$5,$B$4) Initial cost 8.70 <-- =SUMPRODUCT(C8:C10,D8:D10) S T 47 Profit1 11.95 <-- =C8*(MAX($B$14-B8,0)-D8) Profit2 -17.36 <-- =C9*(MAX($B$14-B9,0)-D9)Profit3 -0.29 <-- =C10*(MAX($B$14-B10,0)-D10) Total -5.70 <-- =SUM(B15:B17) S T Payoff -5.70 <-- =B18 0 -8.705 -8.70 10 -8.7015 -8.7020 -8.7025 -3.7030 1.3035 6.3040 1.3045 -3.7050 -8.7055 -8.7060 -8.7065 -8.7070 -8.7075 -8.70One profit example (used in data table) Data table: profit as function of S TBUTTERFLY -10-8-6-4-202468 0 1 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0BuƩerﬂy pro ﬁt Terminal stock price, STBuƩerﬂy Pro ﬁt 767 Simulating Options and Option Strategies Call X SN d t Xe N d t dSXrt tdd trT()= () − () =()++()=−− 12 12 212,, ln ,σ σσ In a table for the butterfly: N Low calls Call X t N SN d X t X e N d X t dXLow Low Low LowrT Low ,, , () = ()() − ()() []− 12 1 LLowLow Low Low tSXrt tdX t dX t t ,ln ,, , () =() ++()() =() −σ σσ2 212 N Mid calls Call X t N SN d X t X e N d X t dXMid Mid Mid MidrT Mid ,, , () = ()() − ()() []− 12 1 MMidMid Mid Mid tSXrt tdX t dX t t ,ln ,, , () =() ++()() =() −σ σσ2 212 N High calls Call X t N SN d X t X e N d X t High High High HighrT High ,, , () = ()() − ()()− 12 [[] () =( )++() () = dX tSXrt tdX t dX t HighHigh High High 12 212,ln ,, ,σ σ(() −σt Adding these together we get Butterfly t S N N d X t N N d X t NtL o w L o w M i d M i d Hig()=∗ ()() +∗ ()() { +11 ,, hhH ighrT Low Low Low Mid MidNd X t e N X Nd X t NX N∗ ()() }+− ∗ ()() { +∗− 12 ,, ddX t N X N dX t Mid High High High 22 ,, ()() +∗ ()() } Newly defined VBA functions: Butterfly t S t ()=∗ butterflyNd X X X N N N Low Mid High Low Mid Hig1, ,, , , hht Low Mid High Low MidSX t r butterflyNd X X X N N,,, , , ,, ,,,σ () −−erT2N NS X t rHigh t,,, , , σ () The VBA function ButterflyNd1 is defined below (the function ButterflyNd2 is similar): 768 Chapter 29 Function butter ﬂ yNd1(XLow, XMid, XHigh, _ NumberLow, NumberMid, NumberHigh, Stock, _ Time, Interest, sigma) butter ﬂ yNd1 = Stock * _ (NumberLow * Application.Norm_S_Dist _ (dOne(Stock, XLow, Time, Interest, sigma), 1) _ + NumberMid * Application.Norm_S_Dist _ (dOne(Stock, XMid, Time, Interest, sigma), 1) _ + NumberHigh * Application.Norm_S_Dist _ (dOne(Stock, XHigh, Time, Interest, sigma), 1)) End Function Self-Financing Butterfly Portfolio We attempt to replicate this position dynamically, maintaining the self- financing requirement (i.e., no cash flows after time t = 0).

All of the replication strategies are based on the idea that the Black-Scholes formula gives the dynamic investment over time in the risky and riskless asset. When implementing this idea, we had to adjust this dynamic formula so that the net investment over time is zero (the so-called self-financing or zero-investment strategies). The replication strategies then become somewhat less than perfect, so that the terminal payoff of these strategies matches the formula 772 Chapter 29 payoff only approximately. For more complicated strategies (we illustrated for a butterfly), the mismatch between the formula and the strategy payoff can be significant. Exercises 1. You are a portfolio manager, and you want to invest in an asset having σ = 40%. You want to create a put on the investment so that at the end of the year you have losses no greater than 5%. Since there is no put on this specific asset, you plan to create a synthetic put by engaging in a dynamic investment strategy—purchasing a portfolio composed of dynami-cally changing proportions of the risky asset and riskless bonds. If the interest rate is 6%, how much should your initial investment be in the portfolio and in the riskless bond? 2. Simulate the above strategy, assuming weekly rebalancing of the portfolio. 3. Go back to the numerical example of section 29.5. Write a VBA function which solves for the implied asset value V a . (Hint: Use the bisection method discussed to compute the implied volatility in section 17.5.) Then use this function to create a graph showing the trade-off between the implied asset value and the asset volatility. 4. You have been offered the chance to purchase stock in a firm. The seller wants $55 per share, but offers to repurchase the stock at the end of one half year for $50 per share. If the σ of the share ’ s log returns is 80% determine the true value per share. Assume that the interest rate is 10%. 5. A covered call is a long stock and short call.

Now implement the following spreadsheet to test the effectiveness of a simulated covered call strategy. 6. Section 29.2 discusses the cashless replication of a call. Use the same logic to program in a spreadsheet the replication of a put. 3 0 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing 30.1 Overview This chapter continues the discussion of the previous chapter and shows how to implement Monte Carlo methods for pricing options. The main objective is to show how to price Asian options and barrier options. Both of these options are path dependent : Their payoffs depend not just on the terminal price of an underlying asset but also on the intermediate asset prices before the terminal price. An Asian option has a payoff which depends on the average price of the underlying asset for some period before option maturity, and a barrier option ’ s payoff depends on the underlying price reaching a particular level at some point before maturity. In sections 30.6–30.9 we will make these general state-ments more explicit. What Does Risk Neutrality Mean? Consider a situation in which there are two basic securities, a riskless bond and a stock. The interest rate on the bond is called the risk-free rate and is usually denoted by r . In the context of this situation of two basic assets, “risk- neutral pricing” can have two meanings. In both meanings of risk-neutrality derivative (i.e., non-basic) securities are priced as the discounted value (at the risk-free rate) of their expected payoffs. The two meanings of risk neutrality differ in the procedure used to arrive at the payoffs of the risky basic security (the stock). • In the first meaning of risk neutrality, we change the underlying distribution of the stock ’ s returns so that the expected stock price is one plus the risk-free rate. To price an option we apply the basic risk-neutral pricing principle of discounting the expected option payoffs by the risk-free rate. In this use of risk neutrality, we transform the stock ’ s returns but compute the expected payoffs using the actual return probabilities. We illustrate this procedure in section 30.2. • The second meaning of risk neutrality uses the binomial model (see Chapter 16). We transform the state prices into risk-neutral probabilities. In this use of risk neutrality, we do not transform the stock ’ s payoffs but instead replace the actual state probabilities by the equivalent risk-neutral probabilities. We then price derivative securities by discounting their expected payoffs at the risk-free rate. 776 Chapter 30 The first method of pricing is ideal for pricing options whose payoffs depend only on the terminal price of the stock. We call such options path independent . The second method is more general and can in principle be used to price any option, even if the payoffs are path dependent. Examples of such options explored in this chapter are Asian and barrier options. Both these options are path-dependent options—options whose price depends not only on the termi-nal price of the asset, but also on the path of the prices by which the terminal price was reached. In general a path-dependent option does not have an ana-lytic price solution. Monte Carlo provides us with a handy numerical tool for pricing such options. Monte Carlo pricing of path-dependent options depends on a simulation of the price path of the underlying asset. The Structure of This Chapter In section 30.2 we show how the first risk-neutrality pricing principle (trans-forming the stock ’ s returns) can be used to Monte Carlo price a standard call and a put. We then continue with the second meaning of risk neutrality and show how it can be used to price barriers and Asian options. To make this chapter more self-contained we include a brief review of state prices and risk neutrality (section 30.3). We then show, in section 30.4, how to price a plain-vanilla option with a Monte Carlo algorithm. Since plain-vanilla options—jargon by which we simply mean European calls and puts on a stock whose price process is lognormal—are accurately priced using the Black-Scholes formula, this exercise allows us to check our pricing method against a known result and also allows us to develop the proper intuitions about the Monte Carlo pricing of more complicated options. 30.2 Pricing a Plain-Vanilla Call Using Monte Carlo Methods In this section we explore the pricing of standard European calls and puts using Monte Carlo. We employ the first meaning of risk neutrality discussed in section 30.1, transforming the returns on the stock so that the stock ’ s expected return is the risk-free rate and then discounting the expected option payoffs at the risk-free rate. To use this complicated model to price European calls and puts with Monte Carlo methods might be viewed as an immense waste of time—the Black-Scholes formula (Chapter 17) gives a wonderful pricing solution for European calls and puts. However, like the example of estimating the value of 777 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing π discussed in Chapter 25, the exercise of pricing a plain-vanilla call using Monte Carlo methods gives us considerable insight into the application of Monte Carlo methods. The Procedure Consider a call on a stock with the parameters given below. This call can be priced using the Black-Scholes formula. We will show how our first risk-neutral procedure of transforming the returns can be used to price this call using Monte Carlo. 1 2 3 45678AB C S0 50 X4 4 T 1 r5 % Sigma 15% Black-Scholes call price 8.5417 < -- =BSCall(B2,B3,B4,B5,B6)BLACK-SCHOLES CALL PRICE We now simulate the option price as follows: • Step 1: We simulate a set of stock prices at time T . The stock prices have the property that they are lognormally distributed with mean r and standard deviation σ . To do this we assume that the stock prices have mean r − σ 2 /2 and standard deviation σ . • Step 2: We compute the terminal payoffs of our option for these stock prices: max( S T − X ,0). • Step 3: We compute the average discounted payoff: exp[ − r * T ]* Average [max( S T − X ,0)]. This should be the same as the Black-Scholes price (and approximately it is). Why Do We Assume That the Stock ’ s Mean Return Is r − σ 2 /2? Suppose that the stock returns are normal with mean μ and standard deviation σ . As discussed in Chapter 26, this means that the expected stock price is S 0 exp[( μ + σ 2 /2) t ]. In our first meaning of risk neutrality, we want to transform the return distribution so that the expected price has mean r . We do this by 778 Chapter 30 replacing μ by r − σ 2 /2. This guarantees that the expected future price of the stock grows at rate r , which is the basic condition for the risk-neutral pricing: St S r t S r t 02 022 0 22 2 exp exp exp μσ σ σ +()[] =− () + ()[] = [] Step 1: Generating the Price Data Having cleared up this theoretical issue, we now return to our computations.

Our main focus will be on the pricing of barrier and Asian options, but the principles are general and can be applied to most derivatives. In this section we start with a brief recapitulation of the basic facts about state prices and risk-neutral pricing discussed in Chapter 16.

For an ordinary call, for example, { Payoff U = max( S * U − X ,0), Payoff D = max( S * D − X ,0)}. We can extend the risk-neutral pricing scheme to multi-period frameworks. Consider a multi-period binomial setting where U and D do not change over time, and indicate the date n state payoffs by Payoff n,j , j = 0, … , n . This notation Payoff n,j indicates the date- n payoff of the asset in a state where there are j up moves on the binomial tree; for a call in a binomial framework Payoff n,j = Max ( S * U j D n − j − X ,0).

It assumes, in other words, that the date- n payoffs are path independent —the option payoff is a function only of the terminal stock price and does not depend on the path by which this price is reached (see Figure 30.1 ). We return to this topic later in this chapter. 2. As discussed in Chapter 16, the risk-neutral probabilities are not the actual probabilities of the state occurrences. They are in fact “pseudo probabilities” which derive from the state prices. 782 Chapter 30 30.4 Pricing a Call Using the Binomial Monte Carlo Model We start with a ridiculously simple example.

In the spreadsheet below we use Monte Carlo methods to price an at-the-money option on a stock whose price today is S 0 = 50. There are two periods, and in each period the stock price goes either Up = 1.4 or Down = 0.9; the interest rate is R = 1.05. Given Up and Down, the stock price tree looks like Figure 30.2 . 784 Chapter 30 The state prices and risk-neutral probabilities are computed in cells B10:B11 and B14:B15. Cells B18:B19 and C18:C19 show two random price paths. In each period we use a random number from Excel generated by the function Rand . If Rand( ) > π D , then the stock price goes Up, and if Rand() ≤ π D then the stock price goes Down. 1 2 34 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32D C B A 0 5 e c i r p k c o t s l a i t i n I 0 5 X 4 . 1 p U 9 . 0 n w o D 5 0 . 1 R State prices qu 0.2857 <-- =(B7-B6)/(B7*(B5-B6)) qd 0.6667 <-- =(B7-B6)/(B7*(B5-B6)) Risk-neutral probabilities u 0.3000 <-- =(B7-B6)/(B7*(B5-B6)) d 0.7000 <-- =(B7-B6)/(B7*(B5-B6)) First period, up (1) or down (0)? 0 0 <-- =IF(RAND()>$B$15,1,0) Second period, up (1) or down (0)? 0 1 <-- =IF(RAND()>$B$15,1,0) Total ups 0 1 <-- =SUM(C18:C19) Terminal stock price 40.5 63 <-- =$B$2*up^C21*down^(2-C21) Option payof f 0 13 <-- =MAX(C22-$B$3,0) Average discounted payoff 5.8957 <-- =AVERAGE(23:23)/R_^2 Computing the actual option price with state prices Payoffs ) 0 , 3 B - 2 ^ p u * 2 B ( X A M = - - < 8 4 p o t ) 0 , 3 B - n w o d * p u * 2 B ( X A M = - - < 3 1 e l d d i m ) 0 , 3 B - 2 ^ n w o d * 2 B ( X A M = - - < 0 m o t t o b ^ p u _ q = - - < 7 0 7 8 . 8 e c i r p n o i t p o l a u t c A 2*B29+2*q_up*q_down*B30+q_down^2*B31Random paths and the Monte Carlo priceSIMPLE SIMULATION: TWO PATHS IN A TWO-DATE MODEL π π 785 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing • In the first price path (cells B18:B19), the stock price goes down in both periods. The terminal stock price is 40.5 and the option ’ s payoff is 0 (cell B23). • In the second price path (cells C18:C19), the stock price goes up in the first period and down in the second period. The terminal stock price is 63 and the option ’ s payoff is 13 (cell C23). If these were the only two random price paths, the Monte Carlo option price would be the discounted average 5.8957 (cell B25). Notice that we have also computed the actual call price using the state prices; cell B32 shows this price to be 8.8707. Risk-Neutral Probabilities in Monte Carlo Notice the role of the risk-neutral probabilities in the Monte Carlo simu- lation: The price path is determined not by the actual probabilities , but by the risk-neutral probabilities π U and π D . There is no role for the actual probabilities in the Monte Carlo pricing. Extending the Two-Period Model You can ’ t, of course, run a Monte Carlo simulation by using only two price paths. In the spreadsheet below, we ’ ve extended our price paths to all the columns in the spreadsheet. Excel ’ s spreadsheet is 256 columns wide; this means that the computation in cell B25 is the average of the option value over 255 simulated price paths. 786 Chapter 30 The average discounted payoff (cell B25) is 8.7502. This value is random, meaning it will change each time we press F9 to produce a new set of random paths. Monte Carlo methods imply that for even more paths we would con- verge to the actual option price of 8.8707. In the next section we show that the Monte Carlo method eventually produces convergence to this price. 30.5 Monte Carlo Plain-Vanilla Call Pricing Converges to Black-Scholes Now that we understand the principles, we extend our logic. We write a VBA routine which prices a plain-vanilla call using Monte Carlo methods under conditions which converge to Black-Scholes pricing. 1 23 4 5678 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17181920 21 2223 24 25 26 2728293031 32I H G F E D C B A 0 5 e c i r p k c o t s l a i t i n I 0 5 X 4 . 1 p U 9 . 0 n w o D 5 0 . 1 R State prices qu 0.2857 <-- =(B7-B6)/(B7*(B5-B6)) qd 0.6667 <-- =(B7-B6)/(B7*(B5-B6)) Risk-neutral probabilities u 0.3000 <-- =(B7-B6)/(B7*(B5-B6)) d 0.7000 <-- =(B7-B6)/(B7*(B5-B6)) First period, up (1) or down (0)? 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 Second period, up (1) or down (0)? 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 Total ups 01201011 Terminal stock price 40.5 63 98 40.5 63 40.5 63 63 Option payoff 01 34 8 01 3 01 31 3 Average discounted payoff 8.7502 <-- =AVERAGE(23:23)/R_^2 Computing the actual option price with state prices Payoffs ) 0 , 3 B - 2 ^ p u * 2 B ( X A M = - - < 8 4 p o t ) 0 , 3 B - n w o d * p u * 2 B ( X A M = - - < 3 1 e l d d i m ) 0 , 3 B - 2 ^ n w o d * 2 B ( X A M = - - < 0 m o t t o b Actual option price 8.8707 <-- =q_up^2*B29+2*q_up*q_down*B30+q_down^2*B31Random paths and the Monte Carlo priceSIMPLE SIMULATION: A TWO-DATE MODEL as many price paths as there are columns pressing F9 runs the simulation and will change the value in cell B25 This value should be compared to the actual option price in cell B32 π π 787 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing Our basic setup is as follows: We price a European call on a stock whose current price is S 0 . The option ’ s exercise price is X , and the time to maturity of the option is T . We assume that the stock price is lognormally distributed with mean μ and standard deviation σ . To price the call using Monte Carlo: • We divide the unit time interval into n divisions. This means that Δ t = 1/ n . • For each Δ t , we define Up t t tΔ ΔΔ =+ ⎡⎣⎤⎦expμσ and Down tΔ= ttΔΔ− ⎡⎣⎤⎦expμσ . The interest rate on the interval Δ t is R Δ t = exp[ r Δ t ]. • This means that the state prices and risk-neutral probabilities are given by qRD o w n RU p D o w nqUp R RU p D o w nutt tt tdtt tt t=− − ()=− − ()ΔΔ ΔΔ ΔΔΔ ΔΔ Δ, πu utt ttdtt ttuRD o w n Up DownUp R Up Down=− −=− −=−ΔΔ ΔΔΔΔ ΔΔ, ππ 1 • Since the time to maturity of the option is T , the price path to T requires m = T / Δ t periods. A price path of length m is created by determining the Up or Down move of the stock as a function of a random number between 0 and 1 and the risk-neutral probability π d . As discussed in the example in section 30.3, if the random number is greater than π d , the stock makes an Up move; other- wise it makes a Down move. A VBA Routine The VBA routine below defines a function VanillaCall . This function requires as inputs the variables mentioned above. The variable Runs is the number of random price paths created; these paths are averaged to determine the Monte Carlo value of the call: 788 Chapter 30 Function VanillaCall(S0, Exercise, Mean, sigma, _ Interest, Time, Divisions, Runs) deltat = 1 / Divisions interestdelta = Exp(Interest * deltat) up = Exp(Mean * deltat + _ sigma * Sqr(deltat)) down = Exp(Mean * deltat - _ sigma * Sqr(deltat)) pathlength = Int(Time / deltat) ‘Risk-neutral probabilities piup = (interestdelta - down) / _ (up - down) pidown = 1 - piup Temp = 0 For Index = 1 To Runs Upcounter = 0 ‘Generate terminal price For j = 1 To pathlength If Rnd > pidown Then Upcounter = _ Upcounter + 1 Next j callvalue = Application.Max(S0 * _ (up ∧ Upcounter) * (down ∧ (pathlength - _ Upcounter)) - Exercise, 0) _ 789 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing The number of Up moves is stored in a counter called Upcounter and the value of the call for each Run is the discounted value of the call payoff for a particular terminal price S 0 * Up Upcounter Down pathlength − Upcounter , where pathlength = Int(Time / deltat) is the integer part of T / Δ t : callvalue = Application.Max(S0 * (up ∧ Upcounter) * _ (down ∧ (pathlength - Upcounter)) _ - Exercise, 0) / (interestdelta ∧ pathlength) The Monte Carlo value of the call is given by: VanillaCall = Temp / Runs . Understanding the Principles of the Monte Carlo Simulation For future reference we state the principles of the Monte Carlo simulation. These principles hold not only for the plain-vanilla options of this section, but also for the Asian options treated later in this chapter: • Price paths are generated by using the risk-neutral probabilities. In the program VanillaCall , for example, the price of the stock moves Up if the random number generator > π D and moves Down if the random number gen- erator ≤ π D . Effectively this means that the risk-neutral probabilities { π U = 1 − π D , π D } of each price path are incorporated into the price path itself. • The value of the option using Monte Carlo is determined by the discounted value of the simple average of all results over the price paths generated. / (interestdelta ∧ pathlength) Temp = Temp + callvalue Next Index VanillaCall = Temp / Runs End Function 790 Chapter 30 The function divides the time to option expiration T = 0.8 (cell B5) into 100 divisions (cell B9), so that Δ t = 1/200. Each time the function is called, it runs 3,000 price paths (cell B10). A particular call of the function shown above produced the value 7.5861 (cell B12), whereas the Black-Scholes call value—computed with the function BSCall defined in Chapter 19—is 7.2782 (cell B14). How good is this MC routine? One way to test it is to run it many times.

The value in cell B14 is the option value as computed by the Black-Scholes formula; the function BSCall was defined in Chapter 19. 791 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing The average value (cell A28) has a relatively low standard deviation (cell A29). The Monte Carlo routine works pretty well. Improving the Efficiency of the MC Routine Monte Carlo routines are inherently very wasteful—you have to run them many times to get a reasonable approximation to the true value. Thus there is a lot of mileage in making a particular routine more efficient. Continuing with our VanillaCall example, we show one example of such an efficiency gain. Suppose that after j random numbers the random price is such that there is no chance that the call option will be in the money. Denote the number of Ups after j random coin tosses by Upcounter ( j ). Then the call option cannot be in the money after n random numbers if S 0 Up Upcounter ( j ) + ( n − j ) Down j − Upcounter ( j ) < X . This formula assumes that all the remaining random numbers (there will be n − j such numbers) will give an Up stock price movement. 1 2 3 456789 1011121314151617181920212223242526272829AB C D E S0 , current stock price 50 X, exercise price 50 r, interest rate 10% T, time 0.8 μ, mean stock return 33% σ, sigma--standard deviation of stock return 30% n, divisions 100 Runs 3,000 VanillaCall 6.9059 <-- =vanillacall(B2,B3,B6,B7,B4,B5,B9,B10) BS call 7.2782 <-- =BSCall(B2,B3,B5,B4,B7) Multiple runs of the function 7.4154 7.0526 7.2989 7.39937.2086 7.1906 7.4140 7.29867.1909 7.0336 7.2967 7.45467.5312 7.3078 7.5679 7.20177.1911 7.0003 6.8358 7.13347.2903 7.3150 7.3853 7.09257.6109 7.3928 7.1644 7.41267.6070 7.2575 7.1837 7.27177.2296 7.5758 7.1568 7.45727.3825 7.0926 7.1412 7.1313 7.2793 <-- =AVERAGE(A17:D26) 0.1765 <-- =STDEV.S(A17:D26)RUNNING THE MONTE CARLO FUNCTION MANY TIMES <-- =vanillacall(B2,B3,B6,B7,B4,B5,B9,B10) 792 Chapter 30 For this case, we should stop choosing random numbers after j and let the call value be zero.

Now that we understand the Monte Carlo technology and its implementation in VBA, we can extend our examples in two directions.

The examples in Figures 30.3 and 30.4 of the oil contract traded on the NYMEX and the traded average price option (TAPO) traded on the London Metals Exchange are this kind of option. • In the second kind of Asian option, the option ’ s exercise price is the average of the underlying asset ’ s price over a period preceding option maturity: Max[Terminal underlying – average underlying, 0]. Such average strike options are common in markets for electric energy. They assist hedgers whose primary risks are related to the average price of the underlying. Asian options are particularly useful when the user sells the underlying during the period and is therefore exposed to the average price and when there is danger of price manipulation in the underlying. The Asian option mitigates the effect of manipulation, since it is based not on a single price, but on a sequence of prices. 3.

This example, which we ’ ve not yet concluded, also illustrates the difficulty of pricing Asian options: Each single path must be dealt with—16 separate paths. This distinguishes Asian options from the case of ordinary options (“plain vanilla,” in the jargon of option pricers); for the particular example we ’ re considering here, a plain-vanilla option requires dealing only with five ending prices. To price the Asian option, we attach a risk-neutral probability to each price path: 1 2 345 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16171819 20 2122 23C B A 0 3 e c i r p k c o t s l a i t i n I 0 4 . 1 p U 0 8 . 0 n w o D 8 0 . 1 t s e r e t n I Option exercise price 30 State price, Up: q U 0.4321 <-- =(B5-B4)/(B5*(B3-B4)) State price, Down, q D 0.4938 <-- =(B3-B5)/(B5*(B3-B4)) Risk-neutral prob., Up 0.4667 <-- =B8*B5 Risk-neutral prob., Down 0.5333 <-- =B9*B5 DatePrice at beginning of periodPrice movement: Up or Down 0 30.000 p U 0 0 0 . 2 4 1 p U 0 0 8 . 8 5 2 n w o D 0 4 0 . 7 4 3 p U 6 5 8 . 5 6 4 Average price along path 48.739 <-- =AVERAGE(B15:B19) Option payoff at path end 18.739 <-- =MAX(B20-$B$6,0) Path risk-neutral price 0.0542 <-- =B11^COUNTIF(C16:C19,\"Up\")*B12^COUNTIF(C16:C19,\"Down\") Value of path: Payoff * risk-neutral price * discount factor 0.747 <-- =B21*B22/B5^4PATH PRICE EXAMPLE: {Up, Up, Down, Up} 801 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing The option price is the discounted expected payoff value, where the expecta- tions are computed with the risk-neutral probabilities: πPath All paths nOption payoff on path R∗ =∑ 5 3756 . 15 1617181920 21 22232425262728293031323334353637P O N M Average stock priceOption payoffPath risk-neutral probability 65.67 35.67 0.0474 <-- =B11^4 40.10 10.10 0.0542 <-- =$B$11^3*$B$12 43.70 13.70 0.054248.74 18.74 0.0542 55.80 25.80 0.0542 27.54 0.00 0.0619 <-- =$B$11^2*$B$12^2 30.42 0.42 0.061934.45 4.45 0.061934.02 4.02 0.061943.09 13.09 0.061938.05 8.05 0.0619 30.80 0.80 0.0708 <-- =$B$11*$B$12^3 27.20 0.00 0.070824.32 0.00 0.070822.01 0.00 0.0708 20.17 0.00 0.0809 <-- =$B$12^4 Option value 5.3756 <-- =SUMPRODUCT(N16:N35,O16:O35)/B5^4 Risk-Neutral Probabilities–Again We repeat our earlier comments (page 789) about the role of risk-neutral probabilities: Each path is priced by its discounted risk-neutral probabil-ity, which is a function of the Up, Down, and R . The actual state prob- abilities are not relevant. 802 Chapter 30 30.7 Pricing Asian Options with a VBA Program Our spreadsheet example in the previous section illustrates both the principle of Monte Carlo pricing of options and the problematics of pricing the options directly in a spreadsheet. For four periods, we require the computation of 2 4 = 16 paths. For a more general problem with n periods, there are 2 n paths to consider; this rapidly becomes too large for even a very powerful computer. In order to accurately price the options, you would need hundreds or thousands of simulations. Doing this in a spreadsheet directly would be cumbersome. The obvious answer is to write some VBA code to automate the process and which allows us to run an arbitrarily large number of simulations. In this section we write VBA code to do a Monte Carlo simulation of Asian pricing options. We generate price paths by simulating a sequence of Up and Down movements of the underlying stock price; the probability of Up or Down depends on the risk-neutral probabilities—in this sense our Monte Carlo simu-lation for Asian options is similar to that illustrated in section 30.4 for plain-vanilla options. For each price path generated, we calculate the option payoff, and after generating a large number of price paths, we compute the option price by discounting and averaging these payoffs. The VBA function, MCAsian , which prices the Asian options, is given below: Function MCAsian(initial, Exercise, Up, Down, _ Interest, Periods, Runs) Dim PricePath() As Double ReDim PricePath(Periods + 1) ‘Risk-neutral probabilities piup = (Interest - Down) / (Up - Down) pidown = 1 - piup Temp = 0 For Index = 1 To Runs ‘Generate path For i = 1 To Periods PricePath(0) = initial 803 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing pathprob = 1 If Rnd > pidown Then PricePath(i) = PricePath(i - 1) _ * Up Else: PricePath(i) = PricePath(i - 1) * _ Down End If Next i PriceAverage = Application.Sum _ (PricePath) / (Periods + 1) callpayoff = Application.Max _ (PriceAverage - Exercise, 0) Temp = Temp + callpayoff Next Index MCAsian = (Temp / Interest ∧ Periods) / _ Runs End Function Here ’ s the implementation of the function in a spreadsheet: 1 2 34 5 678 9C B A 4 . 1 p U 8 . 0 n w o D 8 0 . 1 t s e r e t n I 0 3 e c i r p l a i t i n I 0 2 s d o i r e P 0 3 e s i c r e x E 0 0 5 s n u R Asian call value 9.7253 <-- =MCAsian(B5,B7,B2,B3,B4,B6,B8)PRICING AN ASIAN OPTION BY MONTE CARLO 804 Chapter 30 The function in cell B9 is our Monte Carlo valuation of the option—the simu- lated value.

We follow the procedure of section 30.4 for defining the returns, state prices, and risk-neutral probabilities over the subperiod Δ t . Here is the resulting spreadsheet: 4. The bad news, of course, is that we have to increase the number of runs by a factor of 5 to reduce the standard deviation by one-half. 806 Chapter 30 The block of results in cells A18:F25 gives 48 results for running the function MCAsian .

In this simulation the initia l stock price = 50.00, the exercise price = 45.00, the time to maturity = 0.40, and the unit time interval is divided into 80 subintervals. The stock price process has mean return = 15.00% and standard deviation = 1.25%, and the interest rate = 8.00%. There are 100 runs in each Monte Carlo simulation 807 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing It is clear that increasing the number of runs narrows the bounds on the simulation. 30.8 Pricing Barrier Options with Monte Carlo 5 A barrier option ’ s payoff depends on whether the price reaches a specific level during the life of the option: • A knockin barrier call option has payoff Max( S T − X , 0) only if at some time t < T , S t > K. A knockin put has the same condition but pays off Max( X − S T , 0). • A knockout barrier call or put option has these payoffs provided that at no time before T does the stock price reach the barrier. Imposing a barrier makes it more difficult for an option to be in the money at expiration; thus barrier options have lower value than regular options. A Simple Example of a Barrier Call Option Below we show an extended example for a knockout barrier option which is similar to the example for an Asian option given in section 30.6: 32 33 3435363738 39 40414243 44 4546474849 50 51I H G F E D C B Data table: Sensitivity of results on number of runs RunsAverage of 48 MCAsianMinimum MaximumStandard deviation <-- =B30 , data table header (hidden) 50 5.7832 4.9871 6.6371 0.4255 100 5.7343 4.8668 6.4071 0.3309150 5.7689 5.1077 6.4571 0.3145200 5.7052 5.2953 6.1088 0.2047 250 5.7285 5.3057 6.2896 0.2198 300 5.7208 5.1867 6.4113 0.2666350 5.7163 5.2251 6.1966 0.2093400 5.7248 5.3671 6.3500 0.1972450 5.6868 5.2898 5.9580 0.1707 500 5.7353 5.3822 6.1974 0.1636 550 5.7321 5.1561 6.0600 0.1808 4.04.55.05.56.06.57.0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 450 500 55048 MCAsian Simula Ɵons, Varying the Runs Average Minimum Maximum 5. Pricing barrier options with Monte Carlo isn ’ t necessarily a good idea, but it ’ s a good exercise. See Broadie, Glaserman, and Kou (1997) for a complete discussion. 808 Chapter 30 In this example, we model a five-date, four-period barrier call option. The barrier is 50 (cell B7). A knockout option pays off only if the price never goes through this barrier, and a knockin option pays off only if the stock price goes through the barrier.

This happens for all the paths labeled “TRUE” in column M. To check this condition in cell M17 we use the Boolean function ( = MAX(G17:K17) < $B$7). 6 This function evaluates to TRUE or FALSE, depending on whether the condition is met. Other cells in column M use a similar condition. When used in a formula as in the bullet below, the Boolean function evaluates to 1 if TRUE and to 0 if FALSE. • The terminal stock price S T is greater than the option exercise price of 30. In cell O18 we use the condition M17*MAX(K17-$B$6,0) to evaluate the option payoff. Ⴜ If M17 = 0 (meaning that S t > 50 somewhere along the path and the option was “knocked out”), then the option doesn ’ t pay off. Ⴜ If M17 = 1 (so that S t < 50 throughout the path), then the option has a standard call payoff of max( S T − X ,0). As in all previous cases discussed in this chapter, the barrier call ’ s value is the discounted expected payoff of the option, where the probabilities are the risk-neutral probabilities: Option valuePayoff Rjj all states j==∑π 41 7375 . The Knockin Barrier Call By changing the condition in column O we can price the knockin barrier call. This time we write (in cell O17, for example) the function = (1-M17)*MAX (K17-$B$6,0). The value in M17 tests whether the barrier has never been passed; if this is FALSE (i.e., has a value of zero), then the option is “knocked in” and the payoff is like that of a regular call. If M17 is TRUE, then the barrier has not been passed and the option does not pay off: 6. Boolean functions are discussed in Chapter 33. 810 Chapter 30 The spreadsheets for the knockout and knockin barriers illustrate another principle of pricing barrier options: The price of a knockin plus a knockout call equals the price of a plain-vanilla call: 1 2 3 4567 8 9 10 11 121314 15 16 17 1819 20 21 2223 24 25 26 27282930 31 32 333435 36 3738 39 40 41 42 43AB C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Initial stock price 30 0 4 . 1 p U 0 8 . 0 n w o D 8 0 . 1 t s e r e t n I Option exercise price 30 0 0 . 0 5 r e i r r a B qU 0.4321 <-- =(B5-B4)/(B5*(B3-B4)) qD 0.4938 <-- =(B3-B5)/(B5*(B3-B4)) Risk-neutral probability, up 0.4667 <-- =B9*B5Risk-neutral probability, down 0.5333 <-- =B10*B5 Paths Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Period 4 Period 0 Period 1 Period 2 Period 3 Period 4Max(S t)< Barrier?Path risk-neutral probabilityOption payoff All up (1 path) up up up up 30.00 42.00 58.80 82.32 115.25 FALSE 0.0474 85.25 One down (4 paths) down up up up 30.00 24.00 33.60 47.04 65.86 FALSE 0.0542 35.86 up down up up 30.00 42.00 33.60 47.04 65.86 FALSE 0.0542 35.86 up up down up 30.00 42.00 58.80 47.04 65.86 FALSE 0.0542 35.86 up up up down 30.00 42.00 58.80 82.32 65.86 FALSE 0.0542 35.86 Two down (6 paths) down down up up 30.00 24.00 19.20 26.88 37.63 TRUE 0.0619 0.00 down up down up 30.00 24.00 33.60 26.88 37.63 TRUE 0.0619 0.00 down up up down 30.00 24.00 33.60 47.04 37.63 TRUE 0.0619 0.00 up down down up 30.00 42.00 33.60 26.88 37.63 TRUE 0.0619 0.00 up up down down 30.00 42.00 58.80 47.04 37.63 FALSE 0.0619 7.63 up down up down 30.00 42.00 33.60 47.04 37.63 TRUE 0.0619 0.00 Three down (4 paths) up down down down 30.00 42.00 33.60 26.88 21.50 TRUE 0.0708 0.00 down up down down 30.00 24.00 33.60 26.88 21.50 TRUE 0.0708 0.00 down down up down 30.00 24.00 19.20 26.88 21.50 TRUE 0.0708 0.00 down down down up 30.00 24.00 19.20 15.36 21.50 TRUE 0.0708 0.00 Four down (1 path) down down down down 30.00 24.00 19.20 15.36 12.29 TRUE 0.0809 0.00 Knockin value 9.0334PRICING A KNOCKIN BARRIER OPTION Formula in cell N38: =SUMPRODUCT(O17:O36,N17:N36)/B5^4 Formula in cell O36: =(1-M36)*MAX(K36-$B$6,0)STOCK PRICE Formula in cell M17: =MAX(G17:K17)<$B$7 811 Using Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing 30.9 Using VBA and Monte Carlo to Price a Barrier Option We write two VBA functions to price knockin and knockout barrier options.

But in cases where no analytical formulas are available, Monte Carlo is easy to program in VBA and easy to see in Excel. In this chapter we have illustrated Monte Carlo methods for plain-vanilla options, Asian options, and barrier options. Other variations of path-dependent options and their Monte Carlo solutions are considered in the exercises. Exercises 1. Create a VBA subroutine [call it Exercise1( ) ] which generates a random number and prints it on the screen in a message box that looks like this: Note Use the VBA keyword Rnd . 2. Create a VBA subroutine [call it Exercise2( ) ] which generates five random numbers and prints them out on the screen in a message box like the following: Note Use FormatNumber ( Expression , NumDigitsAfterDecimal ) to print out only four digits. 3. Create a VBA subroutine [call it Exercise3( ) ] which generates five random digits of either 1 or 0 and prints them out on the screen in a message box like the following: 818 Chapter 30 Notes • In the VBA message box, use Chr(13) to start a new line. • Use range names in the spreadsheet to transfer values from the spreadsheet to the VBA routine. 5. Repeat the last exercise. This time compute the average price of a path: 6. Use the function VanillaCall defined in the chapter to create a Data Table in which you can see the relation between the number of runs incorporated in the function and the Black-Scholes value of a call. Your result should look something like the following: 4. Suppose a stock price follows a binomial distribution. We want to create a random price path for the stock in a VBA macro. Here ’ s the input with some sample output.

Chapter 31 discusses Data Tables , Excel ’ s amazing sensitivity analysis tool. An important addition in this edition of Financial Modeling is a discussion of data tables on blank cells. This is a tool we use extensively in our discussions of simulations and Monte Carlo methods in Section V . Chapter 32 discusses matrices, without going into much theory. In Financial Modeling we use matrices primarily in our discussion of portfolio optimization (Section II). Chapter 33 is a compendium of most of the Excel functions used in the book, and Chapter 34 is a discussion of array functions; these are func-tions that take rectangular arrays of cells as arguments and that are entered by pressing [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Enter]. Finally, Chapter 35 covers a grab-bag of Excel hints that we couldn ’ t place anywhere else in this book! The last section of this chapter shows how to put custom-made procedures into Excel ’ s personal notebook. We use this particu-larly to automate the somewhat cumbersome Copy/Paste-as-Picture feature of Excel. 3 1 Data Tables 31.1 Overview Data table commands are powerful commands that make it possible to do complex sensitivity analyses. Excel offers the opportunity to build a table in which only one variable is changed, or one in which two variables are changed. Excel data tables are array functions, and thus change dynamically when related spreadsheet cells are changed. In this chapter you will learn how to build both one-dimensional and two- dimensional Excel data tables. 31.2 An Example Consider a project which has an initial cost of $1,150, and seven subsequent cash flows.

They will be needed below. 31.3 Setting Up a One-Dimensional Data Table We refer to a data table that does sensitivity analysis by varying one parameter as a one-dimensional data table . This section discusses such tables, and section 31.4 discusses two-dimensional data tables. Suppose we want to know how the NPV and IRR are affected by a change in the growth rate. The command Data Table allows us to do this simply. The first step is to set up the table ’ s structure. In the example below, we put the formulas for the NPV and IRR on the top row and we put the variable we wish to vary (in this case the growth rate) in the first column. At this point the table looks like this: 10 11 12 13 14 151617 18 19FGH I J 9 B = 8 B = NPV IRR 101.46 17.6% 0 Growth 5% rate 10% 15% The actual table (as opposed to the labels for the columns and the rows) is outlined in the dark border. The numbers directly under the labels “NPV” and “IRR” refer to the corresponding formulas in the previous picture. Thus, if the cell B8 contains the calculation for the NPV , then the cell under the letters “NPV” contains the formula “ = B8.” Similarly, if the cell B9 contains the original calculation for the IRR, then the cell under “IRR” in the table contains the formula “ = B9.” 825 Data Tables Now do the following: • Highlight the table area (outlined in the dark border). • Activate the command Data|What-if Analysis|Data Table . You will get a dialog box which asks you to indicate a Row input cell and/or a Column input cell . We like to think of a data table spreadsheet as having two parts: • A basic example. • A table that does a sensitivity analysis on the basic example. In our example, the first row of the table contains references to calculations done in our basic example. While there are other ways to do data tables, this structure is both typical and easy to understand. In this case, the variable we wish to change is in the left-hand column of our table, so we leave the Row input cell blank and indicate cell B2 (this cell contains the growth rate in our basic example.) in the Column input cell box. Here ’ s the result: 10 11 12 13 14 151617 18 19FGH I J 9 B = 8 B = NPV IRR 101.46 17.6% 0 -176.46 9.71% Growth 5% -47.82 13.67% rate 10% 101.46 17.60% 15% 274.35 21.50% 826 Chapter 31 31.4 Building a Two-Dimensional Data Table We can also use the Data Table command to vary one formula while changing two parameters. Suppose, for example, that we want to calculate the net present value (NPV) of the cash flows for different growth rates and different discount rates. We create a new table which looks like this: 21 22 2324 25 26FGH I J =B8 101.46 7% 10% 12% 0 5% 10%15%Growth rate -->Discount rate ↓ The upper left-hand corner of the table contains the formula “ = B8” as a refer- ence to the basic example. We now use the Data Table command again. This time we fill in both the Row input cell (indicating cell B3, the site of the discount rate in our basic example) and the Column input cell (indicating cell B2). Here ’ s the result: 21 22 2324 25 26FGH I J =B8 101.46 7% 10% 12% 0 111.09 -10.79 -82.08 5% 297.62 150.74 65.13 10% 515.79 339.09 236.4415% 770.34 558.25 435.41Growth rate -->Discount rate ↓ 827 Data Tables 31.5 An Aesthetic Note: Hiding the Formula Cells Data tables tend to look a bit strange, because the formula being calculated shows up in the data table (in our examples: in the top row of the first data table, and in the left-hand top corner of the second data table). You can make your tables look nicer by hiding the formula cells. To do this, mark the offend- ing cells and use the Format Cells command (or press the right mouse button and go to the Number|Custom ). In the dialog box go to the box marked Type and insert a semicolon into the box. Here ’ s the way this looks for the previous example: 828 Chapter 31 The cell contents will now be hidden. This gives the following result. 10 1112 13 14 15 1617 18 19FGH I J 9 B = 8 B = NPV IRR 0 -176.46 9.71% Growth 5% -47.82 13.67% rate 10% 101.46 17.60% 15% 274.35 21.50% 31.6 Excel Data Tables Are Arrays This means that Excel data tables are dynamically linked to your initial example. When you change a parameter in the original example, the corre-sponding column or row of the data table changes. For example, if we change the initial cash flow from 234 to 300, here ’ s what will happen in the data table pictured above: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19AB C D E F G H I J CF 1 300 Growth rate 10% Discount rate 15% Y e a r 01234567 Cash flow -1150.00 300.00 330.00 363.00 399.30 439.23 483.15 531.47 NPV 454.43 <-- =+B6+NPV(B3,C6:I6) IRR 26.01% <-- =IRR(B6:I6,0) 9 B = 8 B = NPV IRR 0 98.13 17.80% Growth 5% 263.06 21.92% rate 10% 454.43 26.01% 15% 676.09 30.07% 829 Data Tables 31.7 Data Tables on Blank Cells (Advanced) An exciting use of data tables is to run multiple iterations of random simulations. Here ’ s an example: Suppose you use Rand( ) to create 10 random numbers between 0 and 1. This Excel random number generator is discussed in detail in Chapter 24.

Note that the cell referenced in the Data Table dialog box is empty. 831 Data Tables The result looks something like this (“something” because by the nature of this experiment, the results are random, so that each push of F9 will produce a different set of numbers): 832 Chapter 31 A Slightly More Realistic Example (Also More Advanced) Why use this technique? Go back to the pension problems discussed in section 27.6. Suppose you retire at age 75 with € 1,000,000 in savings. You want to invest this 60% in the risky asset that has a mean annual return μ = 11% and a standard deviation of return σ = 30%. You plan to withdraw € 100,000 at the end of this and each of the next 9 years. The amount you ’ ll have left at the end of 10 years depends on the random annual return on the risky asset. As explained in Chapter 26, this can be modeled by using Exp(mu + sigma*Norm.S.Inv(Rand( ))) . We embed this function and the assumptions in the spreadsheet below. The amount left is cell B24. In the example shown below, this number is positive, but it can—depending on the parameters—also be negative. 1 1 2 34 5 6789 10111213 14 1516171819202122 23 2425AB C DE F 0.5948 <-- =RAND()0.0850 <-- =RAND() Mean 0.5053 <-- =AVERAGE(A2:A11)0.9396 <-- =RAND() Variance 0.0717 <-- =VAR.P(A2:A11) 0.4272 <-- =RAND() Sigma 0.2677 <-- =SQRT(E4) 0.1722 <-- =RAND()0.4833 <-- =RAND()0.6271 <-- =RAND()0.8981 <-- =RAND()0.2721 <-- =RAND()0.5537 <-- =RAND() Experiment Mean Variance Sigma 0.5053 0.0717 0.2677 <-- =E5, data table header 1 0.5527 0.1225 0.3500 2 0.4129 0.0624 0.2498 3 0.5433 0.1072 0.3275 4 0.4453 0.0862 0.2937 5 0.3300 0.0420 0.2051 6 0.5339 0.0719 0.2681 7 0.6534 0.0601 0.2451 8 0.2358 0.0157 0.1253 9 0.4701 0.0884 0.2973 10 0.6402 0.0469 0.2165BETTER WAY OF RUNNING THE EXPERIMENT Statistics Data table 1.

If the coin falls on tails, Tareq pays Boris $1. • Simulate 10 rounds of this game, showing Tareq ’ s cumulative winnings. • Use Data Table on a blank cell to simulate 25 games of 10 rounds each, showing Tareq ’ s cumulative winnings. 6. Maria and Shavit are tossing coins. Their game works as follows: • On the first toss, if the coin falls on heads, Shavit pays Maria $1 (and vice versa). • On each successive toss: Ⴜ If the coin falls on heads and Maria is ahead, Shavit pays her the square of her previ- ous winnings. Ⴜ If the coin falls on heads and Shavit is ahead, this cancels all of Maria ’ s debt to Shavit. Simulate Maria ’ s winnings after 10 tosses. 3 2 Matrices 32.1 Overview The portfolio optimization chapters of Financial Modeling (Chapters 8–13) make extensive use of matrices to find efficient portfolios. This chapter con- tains enough information about matrices to make it possible for you to do the calculations required for portfolio mathematics. A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers. All of the following are matrices: A matrix with only one row is also called a row vector ; a matrix with only one column is also called a column vector . A matrix with an equal number of rows and columns is called a square matrix . A single letter is often used to denote a matrix or a vector. In this case we often write, for example, B = [ b ij ], where b ij stands for the entry in row i and column j of the matrix. For a vector we might write A = [ a i ] or C = [ c i ]. Thus for the examples given above: ab c d32 2 1 4 1 41 0 1 30=== = ,, , The matrix B above is symmetric , meaning that b ij = b ji . (The variance- covariance matrices used in the portfolio discussion of Chapters 8–13 are symmetric.) 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 9 10 11ABCDEFGH I Matrix C (column vector) 234 1 3 - 8 - 3 1 3 8 - 1 - 0 1 8 - 3 - 1 1 1 - 3 - 13 -8 -3 -8 10 -1 -3 -1 11 01 3 3Matrix D (a 4 x 3 matrix)Matrix A (a row vector) Matrix B (square 3 x 3 matrix)MATRICES IN EXCEL 840 Chapter 32 32.2 Matrix Operations In this section we briefly review the basic operations on a matrix: multiplying a matrix by a scalar, adding matrices, transposition of matrices, and matrix multiplication. Multiplication by a Scalar Multiplying a matrix by a scalar multiplies every entry in the matrix by the scalar. Thus, for example: . 1 2345 6 789 1011ABCD E Scalar 6 Matrix B 13 -8 -3 -8 10 -1 -3 -1 11 Scalar * Matrix B 78 -48 -18 <-- =D4*$B$2 -48 60 -6-18 -6 66MULTIPLYING A MATRIX BY A SCALAR Matrix Addition Matrices may be added together provided they have the same number of rows and columns. Adding two vectors or matrices is accomplished by adding their corresponding entries. Thus if A = [ a ij ] and B = [ b ij ], A + B = [ a ij + b ij ]: 1 2 34567AB C DE F GH I Sum of A + B 13 23 36 < - - = B 3 + E 3 30 2 35 2 656- 9 8 6 1 4- 351 1 - 1 5 1 - 1 01 271 2 4 - 1 1 11 1ADDITION OF MATRICES Matrix A Matrix B 841 Matrices Matrix Transposition Transposition is an operation by which the rows of a matrix are turned into columns and vice versa. Thus for the matrix E : 1 2 34 5 6 7 8ABCDEFGH I Matrix E Transpose of E: ET 1 2 3 4 1 0 16 <-- {=TRANSPOSE(A3:D5)} 03 7 7 - 9 237 1 6772 3 7 77 4- 9 2TRANSPOSITION OF MATRICES Cells F3:H6 are generated with the array function Transpose(A3:D5). This function is inserted by marking off the target area, typing the formula, and then finishing by pressing [Ctrl]+[Shift]+[Enter] . See Chapter 34 for more details. The illustration above uses the array function Transpose . More details on the use of array functions are given in Chapter 34. Multiplication of Matrices You can multiply matrix A by matrix B to get product AB . However, you can only do this if the number of columns in A equals the number of rows in B . The resulting product AB is a matrix with the number of rows as A and the number of columns as in B . Confused? A couple of examples will help. Suppose that X is a row vector and that Y is a column vector, both with n coordinates: Xx x Yy yn n=[] =⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢ ⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥ ⎥11 /midhorizellipsis/vertellipsis ,. Then the product of X and the product of X and Y are defined by XY x xy yxy n nii in =[]⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢ ⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥ ⎥= =∑ 11 1/midhorizellipsis/vertellipsis . Now suppose that A and B are two matrices, and that A has n columns and p rows and B has n rows and m columns: 842 Chapter 32 Aaa a aa aBbb bb bbn pp p nm m nn m=⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥=⎡ 11 12 1 1211 1 21 2 1/midhorizellipsis /vertellipsis /midhorizellipsis/midhorizellipsis /midhorizellipsis /vertellipsis /midhorizellipsis ⎣ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥. Then the product of A and B , written AB , is defined by the matrix: ABab ab ab ab abhh hn hh hn hh m hn ph h hn ph hm=== = =∑∑ ∑ ∑11 112 11 1 1 1… /vertellipsis /vertellipsis …… h hnth ih hj hn with ij element a b == ∑∑⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥= 11, Note that the ij th coordinate of AB is the product of the i th row of A times the j th column of B . For example, if A B then AB =− −⎡ ⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥=− −⎡⎣⎢⎤⎦⎥=− −−⎡⎣⎢⎤ 269369 1 2 52 442 6 4869 75 120, ⎦ ⎦⎥. The order of matrix multiplication is critical. Multiplication of matrices is not commutative; that is, AB ≠ BA . As the above example shows, the fact that it is possible to multiply A times B does not always imply that the multiplication BA is even defined. To multiply matrices in Excel, we use the array function MMult : 1 2 3 456 7 8ABCDEF 2- 7 6 9 - 1 2 03 - 524 47 4 -52 <-- {=MMULT(A3:B4,D3:F4)} -15 6 12Product ABMatrix B Matrix AMULTIPLYING MATRICES To multiply two matrices together, the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second. Thus we can multiply A times 843 Matrices B , but we cannot multiply B times A . If you try this in Excel, the function MMult will give you an error message: 1 2345678ABCDEF 2- 7 6 9 - 1 2 03 - 524 #VALUE! #VALUE! #VALUE! <-- {=MMULT(D3:F4,A3:B4)}#VALUE! #VALUE! #VALUE!Product BAMatrix B Matrix A MATRIX MULTIPLICATION: Number of c olumns of first matrix must equal number of rows of second matrix 32.3 Matrix Inverses A square matrix I is called the identity matrix if all its off-diagonal entries are 0 and all its diagonal entries are 1. Thus I=⎡ ⎣⎢ ⎢⎢⎢⎢⎢⎤ ⎦⎥ ⎥⎥⎥⎥⎥10 00 01 00 00 10 00 01/midhorizellipsis/midhorizellipsis /vertellipsis/vertellipsis /vertellipsis/vertellipsis /midhorizellipsis It is easy to confirm that multiplying any matrix A by the identity matrix of the proper dimension leaves that A unchanged. Thus, if I n is an n × n identity matrix and A is an n × m matrix, IA = A . Similarly, if I m is an m × m identity matrix, AI = A . Now suppose we are given a square matrix A of dimension n . The n × n matrix A − 1 is called the inverse of A if A − 1 A = AA − 1 = I . The computation of an inverse matrix can be a lot of work; fortunately, however Excel has the array function MInverse which does the calculations for us. Here ’ s an example: 844 Chapter 32 As illustrated above, you can use MMult to verify that the product of the above matrix and its inverse indeed give the identity matrix. Expressions like 1.07E-15 mean 1.07*10 − 15 , and are thus essentially zero; you can use Format|Cells|Number to specify the number of decimal places and get rid of these ugly expressions: 1 234567 8 9 10 11 1213AB C D EFG HI J 1 -9 16 1 -0.0217 1.8913 0.5362 -1.1449 <-- {=MINVERSE(A3:D6)} 3 3 2 3 0.0000 -1.0000 -0.1667 0.6667 2 4 0 -2 0.0652 -0.6739 -0.1087 0.4348 5 7 3 4 -0.0217 -0.1087 -0.2971 0.1884 1 1.07E-15 -2.22045E-16 -9.4369E-16 0 1 -1.11022E-16 2.22045E-16 6.94E-18 8.33E-17 1 5.55112E-16 1.39E-17 1.17E-15 -4.44089E-16 1Verifying the inverse We multiply A*Inverse A: cells below contain array function {=MMULT(A3:D6,F3:I6)}Matrix AMATRIX INVERSE Use array function Minverse to compute the inverse of a square matrix Inverse of A 9 10 111213AB C D 1.0000 0.0000 0.0000 0.00000.0000 1.0000 0.0000 0.00000.0000 0.0000 1.0000 0.00000.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1.0000We multiply A*Inverse A: cells below contain array function {=MMULT(A3:D6,F3:I6)} A square matrix that has an inverse is called a nonsingular matrix . The conditions for a matrix to be nonsingular are the following: Consider a square matrix A of dimension n . It can be shown that A = [ a ij ] is nonsingular if and only if the only solution to the n equations ax j nij i i∑ ==01,, ,… is x i = 0, i = 1, … , n . Matrix inversion is a tricky business. If there exists a vector X whose components are almost zero and which solves the above system, then the matrix is ill-conditioned , and it may be very difficult to find an accurate inverse. 845 Matrices 32.4 Solving Systems of Simultaneous Linear Equations A system of n linear equations in m unknown is written as: ax ax ax y ax ax a x y ax axnn n nn11 1 12 2 1 1 21 1 22 1 2 1 2 11 21++ += ++ += ++/midhorizellipsis /midhorizellipsis /vertellipsis /midhorizellipsis ++=ax ynn n 1 Writing the matrix of coefficients as A = [ a ij ], the column vector of unknowns as X = [ x j ], and the column vector of constants as Y = [ y j ], we may write the above system in matrix notation as AX = Y . Not every system of linear equations has a solution, and not every solution of such a system is unique. The system AX = Y always has a unique solution, however, if the matrix A is square and nonsingular. In this case the solution is found by pre-multiplying both sides of the equation AX = Y by the inverse of A : since AX Y A AX A Y X A Y =⇒ = ⇒ =−− −11 1 Here is an example. Suppose we want to solve the 3 x 3 system of equations: 3 4 66 16 33 77 42 3 2 1212 3 23 12 3xx x xx xx x++ = −+ = ++ = We set this up and solve it in Excel as follows: 1 2 34567 8 9 10H G F E D C B A Column vector ySolution A -1 Y 3 4 66 16 0.4343 0 -33 1 77 -2.3223 <-- {=MMULT(MINVERSE(A3:C5),E3:E5)} 42 3 2 12 0.3634 Checking that the solution works 1677 <-- {=MMULT(A3:C5,G3:G5)}12Matrix A of coefficients SOLVING SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS In cells B8:B10 we check that the solution indeed solves the system by multiplying the matrix A times the column vector G3:G5. 846 Chapter 32 32.5 Some Homemade Matrix Functions In the chapters on portfolio problems we use a number of matrix functions that are not included in Excel. The functions in this section need to be embed-ded into the spreadsheet where they are used—see the Technical Note at the beginning of this book or Chapter 36 of the VBA section. Variance-Covariance Matrix When dealing with stock returns, we often need to compute the variance-covariance matrix. The following function does the trick: ‘My thanks to Amir Kirsch and Beni Czaczkes Function VarCovar(rng As Range) As Variant Dim i As Integer Dim j As Integer Dim numcols As Integer numcols = rng.Columns.Count numrows = rng.Rows.Count Dim matrix() As Double ReDim matrix(numcols - 1, numcols - 1) For i = 1 To numcols For j = 1 To numcols matrix(i - 1, j - 1) = _ Application.WorksheetFunction. _ Covar(rng.Columns(i), rng.Columns(j)) _ * numrows / (numrows - 1) Next j Next i VarCovar = matrix End Function Here is an application.

This chapter surveys only those functions used in this book. The functions discussed are the following: • Financial functions: NPV , IRR , PV , PMT , XIRR , and XNPV • Date functions: Now , Today , Date , Weekday , Month , Datedif • Statistical functions: Average , Var , Varp , Stdev , Stdevp , Correl , Covar • Regression functions: Slope , Intercept , Rsq , Linest • Conditional functions: If , VLookup , HLookup • Large , Rank , Percentile , Percentrank • Count , CountA , CountIf • Offset A separate chapter, Chapter 34, is devoted to the important topic of array functions. 33.2 Financial Functions Excel has a large number of financial functions. The main functions used in this book are explored in this section. NPV The Excel definition of NPV differs somewhat from the standard finance defi- nition. In the finance literature, the net present value of a sequence of cash flows C 0 , C 1 , C 2 , …, C n at a discount rate r refers to the expression C rCC rt t tn t t tn 11 00 1 +()+ +() ==∑∑ or In many cases C 0 represents the cost of the asset purchased and is therefore negative. The Excel definition of NPV always assumes that the first cash flow occurs after one period. The user who wants the standard finance expression must therefore calculate NPV(r,{C 1 , … , C n }) + C 0 . Here is an example: 856 Chapter 33 The NPV function has a potential bug: It differentiates between blank cells and cells containing zeros. This can cause some confusion, as can be seen in the example below. The present value of the cash flows in B5:B7 is 65.75, which corresponds to 100 11 53. . But in the otherwise similar example of the cash flows in B11:B13, Excel ’ s NPV function regards the first cash flow as being 100, and returns the answer 100 11 586 96..= . So—in using NPV you have to be explicit in putting in zeros for zero cash flows. 1 2 3 4 56789 10 11 12 1314AB C D Discount rate 10% Year Cash flowPresent value 0 -100.00 -100.00 <-- =B5/(1+$B$2)^A5 1 35.00 31.82 2 33.00 27.27 3 34.00 25.54 4 25.00 17.08 5 16.00 9.93 111.65 <-- =SUM(C6:C10)111.65 <-- =NPV(B2,B6:B10) Net present value 11.65 <-- =B5+NPV(B2,B6:B10)EXCEL'S NPV FUNCTION Present valueof future cash flows 1 2 3 4567 8 9 101112 13 14AB C Discount rate 15% Year Cash flow 10 .00 20 .00 3 100.00 Present value 65.75 <-- =NPV(B2,B5:B7) Year Cash flow 12 3 100.00 Present value 86.96 <-- =NPV(B2,B11:B13)NPV IGNORES BLANK CELLS! 857 Excel Functions IRR The internal rate of return (IRR) of a sequence of cash flows C 0 , C 1 , C 2 , …, C n is an interest rate r such that the net present value of the cash flows is zero: C rt t tn 10 0+()= =∑ The Excel syntax for the IRR function is IRR(cash flows , guess) . Here cash flows represents the whole sequence of cash flows, including the first cash flow C 0 , and guess is an optional starting point for the algorithm which calculates the IRR. 12 345 6 789 10 11C B A Year Cash flow 0- 1 0 0 13 5 23 3 33 4 42 5 51 6 IRR 15.00% <-- =IRR(B3:B8) 15.00% <-- =IRR(B3:B8,5%), IRR Guess = 5%EXCEL'S IRR FUNCTION Guess is not required, and when there is only one IRR it is usually irrelevant: 858 Chapter 33 If there are multiple IRRs, then choice of guess can make a difference. Consider, for example, the following cash flows: 1 2 3456789 10111213141516ABCDEFGH I YearCash flows 0 -11,0001 15,0002 15,0003 15,0004 15,0005 15,0006 15,0007 15,0008 15,0009 15,000 10 -135,000 IRR 1.86% <-- =IRR(B3:B13,0) 135.99% <-- =IRR(B3:B13,2)MULTIPLE IRRs -15,000-10,000-5,00005,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,000 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% 120% 140% 160%NPV Discount rateNPV of Cash Flows The graph (created from a Data Table which is not shown) shows that there are two IRRs, since the NPV curve crosses the x -axis twice. To find both these IRRs, we have to change the guess (though the precise value of guess is still not critical). In the example below we have changed both guesses, but still get the same answer: 15 16ABCD IRR 1.86% <-- =IRR(B3:B13,0) 135.99% <-- =IRR(B3:B13,2) Note A given set of cash flows typically has more than one IRR if there is more than one change of sign in the cash flows—in the above example, the initial cash flow is negative, and CF 1 –CF 9 are positive (this accounts for one change of sign); but then CF 10 is negative—making a second change of sign. If you suspect that a set of cash flows has more than one IRR, the first thing to do is to use Excel to make a graph of the NPVs, as we did above. The 859 Excel Functions number of times that the NPV graph crosses the x -axis identifies the number of IRRs (and also their approximate values). PV This function calculates the present value of an annuity (a series of fixed periodic payments). For example: 1 2 3 4 56AB C Rate 10% Number of periods 10.00Periodic payment 100.00Present value -614.46 <-- =PV(B3,B4,B5)THE PV FUNCTION Payments made at the end of the period 9 10 11 12 13AB C Rate 10% Number of periods 10.00 Periodic payment 100.00 Present value -675.90 <-- =PV(B10,B11,B12,,1)Payments made at the beginning of the period Thus $. .614 46100 11 0 110 =()=∑ t t . Here are two things to note about the PV function: • Writing PV(B3,B4,B5) assumes that payments are made at dates 1, 2, … , 10. If the payments are made at dates 0, 1, 2, … , 9, you should write: The formula PV(B10,B11,B12,,1) can also be generated from the dialog box: 860 Chapter 33 • Irritatingly, the PV function (and the PMT , IPMT , and PPMT functions— see below) produces a negative answer when the payment or future value is positive (there is a logic here, but it ’ s not worth explaining). The solution is obvious: Either write -PV(B3,B4,B5) or let the payment be negative by writing PV(B3,B4,-B5) . PMT This function calculates the payment necessary to pay off a loan with equal payments over a fixed number of periods. For example, the first calculation below shows that a loan of $1,000, to be paid off over 10 years at an interest rate of 8% will require equal annual payments of interest and principal of $149.03. The calculation performed is the solution of the following equation: X rInitial loan principalt tn 11+()= =∑ 861 Excel Functions Loan tables can be calculated using the PMT function. These tables—explained in detail in Chapter 1—show the split between interest and principal of each payment. In each period, the payment on the loan (calculated with PMT ) is split: • We first calculate the interest owing for that period on the principal outstand- ing at the beginning of the period. In the table below, at the end of year 1, we owe $80 ( = 8% * $1,000) of interest on the loan principal outstanding at the beginning of the year. • The remainder of the payment (for year 1: $69.03) goes to reduce the prin- cipal outstanding. 1 2 345 6 789 10 11 12AB C Rate 8% Number of periods 10.00Principal 1,000.00 Payment -149.03 <-- =PMT(B3,B4,B5) Rate 8% Number of periods 10.00 Principal 1,000.00 Payment -137.99 <-- =PMT(B9,B10,B11,,1)Payments made at the end of the period THE PMT FUNCTION Payments made at the beginning of the period 862 Chapter 33 Note that at the end of the 10 years the repayment of principal is exactly equal to the principal outstanding at the beginning of the year (i.e., the loan has been paid off). The Functions IPMT and PPMT As you have seen above, a loan table shows the split of a loan ’ s flat payments (computed with PMT ) between interest and principal. In the loan table of the previous subsection, we computed this split by first computing the flat payment per period (column C), then taking the interest on the principal at the beginning of the period (column D), and finally subtracting this interest from the period ’ s total payment (column E). IPMT and PPMT perform this calculation without the necessity of relying on the total payment.

Here ’ s the way it appears: Note that in the formula bar (indicated by the arrow above), Excel interprets the date entered as 03-02-2015 . 1 When you reformat the cell as Format Cells|Number|General , you see that Excel interprets this date as the number 42038, the number 1 being 1 January 1900. 1. The way this appears and is interpreted depends on the Regional Settings entered in the Windows Control Panel. Spreadsheet dates can be subtracted: In the spreadsheet below we ’ ve entered two dates and subtracted them to find the number of days between the dates: 865 Excel Functions You can also add a number to a date to find another date. What, for example, was the date 165 days after 16 November 1947? 1 2 3AB C Date1 15-Aug-40 Date2 28-Sep-52 Days between 4427 <-- =B2-B1 5 6BC 16-Nov-47 29-Apr-48 <-- =B5+165 Stretching Out Dates In the two cells below we ’ ve put in two dates and then “stretched” the cells out to add more dates with the same difference between them: Write in two dates; mark both cells. Grab the handle (arrow on previ- ous drawing) and pull The result: More dates added with same spacing (in this case, 6 months): Times in a Spreadsheet Hours, minutes, etc., can also be typed into a cell. In the cell below, we ’ ve typed in 8:22: 866 Chapter 33 When we hit [Enter], Excel interprets this as 8:22 AM: EXCEL RECOGNIZES 24-HOUR CLOCK As entered When you hit [Enter] Excel recognizes 24-hour times and also recognizes the symbol a for AM and p for PM: As entered Note that the p is separated from the time by a space. (Of course AM is represented by an a .)When you hit [Enter] 867 Excel Functions When you reformat the cells above with Format|Cells|Number|General , you can see that times are represented in Excel as fractions of a day: 3 45BCD 3:48 PM8:16 AM7:32 AM <-- =B3-B4 345BCD 0.6583330.3444440.313889 <-- =B3-B4 If you type in a date and a time and reformat, you can also see this: Here ’ s what you typed: Here ’ s how it appears: If you reformat this to General : You can subtract times just like you subtract dates; cell B5 below tells you that 7 hours and 32 minutes have elapsed between the two times (ignore the “AM” in B5): 868 Chapter 33 Time and Date Functions in Excel Excel has a whole set of time and date functions. Here are several functions which we find useful: • Now reads the computer clock and represents the date and the time. Now takes no arguments and is written with empty parentheses: Now( ) . • Today reads the computer ’ s clock and prints the date. This function, like Now , is written with empty parentheses: Today( ) . • Date(yyyy,mm,dd) gives the date entered. • Weekday gives the day of the week • Month, Weeknum, Day give the month, week, day of a date Here are some of these functions in a spreadsheet: 1 23456789 1011121314151617AB C Serial representationDate/Time Format 41620.41885 12-12-13 10:03 <-- =NOW() 41620 12-12-13 <-- =TODAY()43924 Apr-3-2020 <-- =DATE(2020,4,3) Different formatting of Now() 12-Dec-13 <-- =NOW() 12-12-13 10:03 <-- =NOW() 10:03 AM <-- =NOW() Using Weekday, Month, Weeknum, Day 5 <-- =WEEKDAY(NOW())5 <-- =WEEKDAY(\"3apr1947\")4 <-- =MONTH(B4) 12 <-- =MONTH(NOW())50 <-- =WEEKNUM(NOW())12 <-- =DAY(NOW()) Calculating the Difference Between Two Dates: The Function Datedif The Excel function Datedif computes the difference between two dates in various useful ways: 869 Excel Functions 33.4 The Functions XIRR, XNPV The functions XIRR and XNPV calculate the internal rate of return and the net present value for a series of cash flows received on specific dates. They are especially useful for calculating IRR and NPV when the dates are unevenly spaced. 2 If you do not have these functions, you will have to go to File|Options|Add-Ins|Manage .

Excel ’ s IRR function assumes that the first cash flow occurs today, the next cash flow occurs one period hence, the following cash flow two periods hence, etc. Excel ’ s NPV function assumes that the first cash flow occurs one period from now, the next cash flow in two periods, etc. We call this “even spacing of cash flows.” When this is not the case, you ’ ll need the XIRR and XNPV functions. 870 Chapter 33 The XIRR function works by discounting each cash flow at the daily rate. In our example the first cash flow of $100 occurs 48 days from now, the second in 149 days, … The XIRR transforms 21.97% to a daily rate and uses it to discount the cash flows: −+()+()++()600100 1 2197100 1 2197100 1 219748 365 149 365 3..... .// 1 140 3650/= 1 2 3456 7 89 10 11 12131415 16AB C Date Payment 16-Feb-01 -600 05-Apr-01 100 15-Jul-01 100 22-Sep-01 10022-Sep-02 100 22-Sep-03 10022-Sep-04 10022-Sep-05 100 22-Sep-06 100 22-Sep-07 10022-Sep-08 10022-Sep-09 100 XIRR 21.97% <-- =XIRR(B3:B14,A3:A14)THE EXCEL XIRR FUNCTION XIRR Here ’ s an example: You pay $600 on 16 February 2001 for an asset that repays $100 on 5 April, $100 on 15 July 2001, and then $100 on every 22 September from 2001 until 2009. The dates are not evenly spaced, so that you cannot use IRR . With XIRR (cell B16 below), you can compute the annualized IRR (the effective annual interest rate EAIR, as defined in Chapter 2). 871 Excel Functions XNPV The XNPV function computes the NPV for unevenly spaced cash flows. In the example below, we use the function to compute the NPV on the same example we used for XIRR . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19AB C D E Date Payment Days from initial datePresent value 3 B = - - < 0 0 . 0 0 6 - 0 0 6 - 1 0 - b e F - 6 1 05-Apr-01 100 48 97.42 <-- =B4/(1+$B$16)^(C4/365) 15-Jul-01 100 149 92.21 <-- =B5/(1+$B$16)^(C5/365) 22-Sep-01 100 218 88.81 <-- =B6/(1+$B$16)^(C6/365) 22-Sep-02 100 583 72.81 <-- =B7/(1+$B$16)^(C7/365) 22-Sep-03 100 948 59.70 <-- =B8/(1+$B$16)^(C8/365) 22-Sep-04 100 1,314 48.91 22-Sep-05 100 1,679 40.10 22-Sep-06 100 2,044 32.88 22-Sep-07 100 2,409 26.96 22-Sep-08 100 2,775 22.09 22-Sep-09 100 3,140 18.11 XIRR 21.97% <-- =XIRR(B3:B14,A3:A14) 0.00 <-- =SUM(D3:D14)HOW DOES XIRR WORK? XIRR computes the daily internal rate of return Cell C4 contains the formula =A4-$A$3 872 Chapter 33 Notice that XNPV requires you to indicate all the cash flows (starting with the initial cash flow), as opposed to NPV , which starts from the first cash flow. Bugs in XIRR and XNPV XIRR and XNPV address the problems of discounting when cash flows are time dated, but they have two bugs: XNPV does not work with zero discount rates, and XIRR does not solve multiple internal rates of return. Below we discuss these problems. We then define two new functions, NXNPV and NXIRR , that solve these problems. These two functions are included as addi- tional functions in the spreadsheet that accompanies this chapter. 3 Problem: XNPV Doesn ’ t Work with Zero Discount Rates XNPV works fine with positive discount rates but fails when discount rates are zero. 4 We illustrate this below. 1 2 345 6 7 8 9 10 11 1213 14 15 16 17AB C Date Payment 16-Feb-01 -600 05-Apr-01 100 15-Jul-01 100 22-Sep-01 100 22-Sep-02 100 22-Sep-03 100 22-Sep-04 100 22-Sep-05 100 22-Sep-06 100 22-Sep-07 10022-Sep-08 100 22-Sep-09 100 Discount rate 15% XNPV 97.29 <-- =XNPV(B16,B3:B14,A3:A14)THE EXCEL XNPV FUNCTION 3. The two additional functions NXIRR and NXNPV were developed by Benjamin Czaczkes. Read “Adding Getformula to Your Spreadsheet” on the disk that accompanies this book to see how you can copy these functions into your own spreadsheets. 4. Recall that when the discount rate is zero, the net present value is just the sum of all the cash flows. 873 Excel Functions Our new function NXNPV solves this problem: 1 2 3456789 1011AB C DE F Discount rate 3% Discount rate 0% XNPV 579.00 <-- =XNPV(B2,B 6:B11,A6:A11) XNPV #NUM! <-- =XNPV(E2,E6:E11,D6:D11) Date Cash flow Date Cash flow 13-Jan-12 -1,000 13-Jan-12 -1,000 18-Aug-12 115 18-Aug-12 115 20-Jan-13 121 20-Jan-13 121 15-Jul-13 100 15-Jul-13 100 01-Jan-14 333 01-Jan-14 333 16-Jul-14 1,011 16-Jul-14 1,011XNPV DOES NOT WORK WITH ZERO DISCOUNT RATES 1 2 3456789 1011F E D C B A % 0 e t a r t n u o c s i D % 3 e t a r t n u o c s i D XNPV 579.00 <-- =nXNPV(B2,B6:B11,A6:A11) XNPV 680 <-- =nXNPV(E2,E6:E11,D6:D11) w o l f h s a C e t a D w o l f h s a C e t a D 0 0 0 , 1 - 2 1 - n a J - 3 1 0 0 0 , 1 - 2 1 - n a J - 3 1 5 1 1 2 1 - g u A - 8 1 5 1 1 2 1 - g u A - 8 1 1 2 1 3 1 - n a J - 0 2 1 2 1 3 1 - n a J - 0 2 0 0 1 3 1 - l u J - 5 1 0 0 1 3 1 - l u J - 5 1 3 3 3 4 1 - n a J - 1 0 3 3 3 4 1 - n a J - 1 0 1 1 0 , 1 4 1 - l u J - 6 1 1 1 0 , 1 4 1 - l u J - 6 1NXNPV SOLVES THE PROBLEM Problem: XIRR Doesn ’ t Work with Two IRRs The Guess switch on XIRR doesn ’ t work.

We illustrate these functions using the following example. Note that with the introduction of Excel 2013, some of these functions have been renamed, though all of the functions still work; thus, for example, the population variance can be computed with the function Var (old versions of Excel) or Var.p (new versions). 1 2 3456789 1011121314151617181920212223242526272829AB C D E F G H Observation X Y 1 35.30 10.98 2 29.70 11.13 3 30.80 12.51 4 58.80 8.40 5 61.40 9.27 6 71.30 8.73 7 74.40 6.36 8 76.70 8.50 9 70.70 7.82 10 57.50 9.14 Average 56.66 9.28 <-- =AVERAGE(C3:C12) Correlation -0.9049 <-- =CORREL(B2:B12,C2:C12) Sample variance 334.15 3.23 <-- =VAR(C3:C12) Co variance 40.4206 <-- =COVAR(B19:B29,C19:C29) 334.15 3.23 <-- =VAR.S(C3:C12) 44.4627 <-- =COVARIANCE.S(B19:B29,C19:C29) Population variance 300.73 2.91 <-- =VARP(C3:C12 ) 40.4206 <-- =COVARIANCE.P(B19:B29,C19:C29) 300.73 2.91 <-- =VAR.P(C3:C12) Sample standard deviation 18.28 1.80 <-- =STDEV(C3:C12) Regression intercept 14.3285 <-- =INTERCEPT(C3:C12,B3:B12) 18.28 1.80 <-- =SQRT(C21) Regression slope -0.0890 <-- =SLOPE(C3:C12,B3:B12) 18.28 1.80 <-- =STDEV.S(C3:C12) Regression r-squared 0.8189 <-- =RSQ(C3:C12,B3:B12) Population standard deviation 17.34 1.71 <-- =STDEVP(C3:C12) 17.34 1.71 <-- =SQRT(C22)17.34 1.71 <-- =STDEV.P(C3:C12)BASIC STATISTICAL FUNCTIONS y = -0.089x + 14.328 R² = 0.8189 678910111213 25 35 45 55 65 75 85Regression via XY Plot The functions Varp , Var.p , Stdevp , and Stdev.p calculate the population variance and standard deviation, whereas the functions Var, Stdev , Var.s , Stdev.s compute the sample variance and standard deviation. The difference between these two functions is that Varp assumes that your data are the whole population and thus divides by the number of data points, whereas Var assumes that the data are samples from the distribution: Varp x xNx Average x x Stdevp x xNi N iN N112 1 11,, ,, ,,…… …() =− () () ()=∑ = = () () =−− () () =Varp x x Var x xNx Average x xN Ni N iN1 112 11 1,, ,, ,,… …… ∑ ∑ () = () Stdev x x Var x x NN 11,, ,, …… 876 Chapter 33 Covar, Covariance.s, Covariance.p, and Correl These functions—used extensively in the portfolio chapters (8–13)—are used to compute the covariance and correlation of two series of numbers. The func-tions Covariance.s and Covariance.p (computing the sample and the popula- tion covariance respectively) are new with Excel 2013. For the definitions, we refer you to section 8.2. Below is an example in which we compute the covari-ance and correlation for returns on McDonald ’ s stock and Wendy ’ s stock. Note the two computations for the correlation. In the first (cell E9) we use the Excel Correl function; in cell E10 we use the definition correlation = Correlation (MCD, WEN) = Covar (MCD, WEN) / ( σ MCD * σ WEN ) . The function Covar is the population covariance (that is, divides by 1/ M , where M is the population size). Cells E11 and E12 give two more variations to the calculation of the correlation. 1 2 3 45 6 78 9 10 11 12 13 1415 16 17 18F E D C B A Date MCD WEN Covariance 1-Aug-05 4.01% -8.97% 0.00085 <-- =COVAR(B3:B26,C3:C26) 1-Sep-05 3.14% -4.30% 0.00085 <-- =COVARIANCE.P(B3:B26,C3:C26) 3-Oct-05 -5.78% 3.42% 0.00085 <-- =COVARIANCE.P(B3:B26,C3:C26) 1-Nov-05 8.89% 8.71% 0.00089 <-- =COVARIANCE.S(B3:B26,C3:C26)1-Dec-05 -0.36% 8.44% 3-Jan-06 3.76% 6.47% Correlation 1-Feb-06 -0.29% -1.52% 0.36204 <-- =CORREL(B3:B26,C3:C26) 1-Mar-06 -1.60% 6.97% 0.36204 <-- =COVAR(B3:B26,C3:C26)/(STDEVP(B3:B26)*STDEVP(C3:C26)) 3-Apr-06 0.62% -0.45% 0.36204 <-- =COVARIANCE.P(B3:B26,C3:C26)/(STDEV.P(B3:B26)*STDEV.P(C3:C26)) 1-May-06 -4.14% -2.20% 0.36204 <-- =COVARIANCE.S(B3:B26,C3:C26)/(STDEV.S(B3:B26)*STDEV.S(C3:C26)) 1-Jun-06 1.29% -3.35% 3-Jul-06 5.20% 3.17% 1-Aug-06 1.41% 6.29% 1-Sep-06 8.61% 4.74% 2-Oct-06 6.90% 9.76% 1-Nov-06 2.53% -5.79%COMPUTING COVARIANCE AND CORRELATION FOR MCDONALD'S (MCD) AND WENDY'S (WEN) Highlighted cells are new functions with Excel 2013 Computing Statistics for a Database Excel has a whole family of statistical functions that works on databases. These functions all start with the letter “D” (for “data,” get it?). The list includes DAverage , DCount , DMin , DVar (the sample variance), DVarP (the population variance), DStdev , and DStevP . There are more, but we ’ ll leave them to you to explore. 877 Excel Functions To see how these functions work, consider the following example: We have a set of monthly stock prices and returns for Apple. Suppose we want to cal- culate the average return of all the returns that are greater than 10%: 1 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 1011ABC DE FGH I Date AAPL n r u t e R L P A A e t a D n r u t e R % 0 1 > 9 6 . 7 1 0 - p e S - 7 1-Oct-01 8.70 12.34% <-- =LN(B5/B4) 4 H : 3 F , 3 , 0 4 1 C : 3 A ( E G A R E V A D = - - < % 8 3 . 5 1 e g a r e v A % 8 3 . 9 1 6 5 . 0 1 1 0 - v o N - 1 ) ) 4 H : 3 F , 3 , 0 4 1 C : 3 A ( R A V D = - - < 1 2 0 0 . 0 e c n a i r a V % 1 7 . 2 5 8 . 0 1 1 0 - c e D - 3 ) 4 H : 3 F , 3 , 0 4 1 C : 3 A ( V E D T S D = - - < % 5 5 . 4 a m g i S % 4 1 . 2 1 5 2 . 2 1 2 0 - n a J - 2 1-Feb-02 10.75 -13.06% 1-Mar-02 11.73 8.72% 1-Apr-02 12.03 2.53%MANIPULATING APPLE STOCK RETURNS, PRICES USING DAVERAGE, DVAR, etc. Criterion range (2 rows) Looking at the above example, we see that there are three parts: • The database is in cells A3:C140. It has headers Date , AAPL , Return . • There is a two-row Criterion range : The top row matches the headers of the database, and the bottom row has “ > 10%” under Return . • Now the functions: DAverage(A3:C140,3,F3:H4) computes the average for all returns that are greater than 10%. DVar with the arguments computes the population variance, and DStdev … If you change the criterion range, you get a different answer: 2 345 6 78FGH I Date AAPL Return <9% Average -1.71% <-- =DAVERAGE(A3:C140,3,F3:H4 ) Variance 0.0078 <-- =DVAR(A3:C140,3,F3:H4)Sigma 8.83% <-- =DSTDEV(A3:C140,3,F3:H4)Criterion range (2 rows) 878 Chapter 33 We ’ ve put the date in cell G11, and used the Text function to create an appropriate criterion under the Date header. One more example and we leave the rest to you. We want to find Apple ’ s return statistics for each of the years. We expand the database and the criterion range by adding in the year. A single example for 2001 shows the average return and sigma for that year to be 11.47% and 3.47%. 5 Running a data table with Year as the parameter to be varied gives the results below: 2 3 456 7 89 1011FGH I DateAAPL stock price Return ) \" 0 \" , 1 1 G ( T X E T & \" > \" = - - < 3 5 3 8 3 > Average 2.88% <-- =DAVERAGE(A3:C140,3,F3:H4 ) Variance 0.0114 <-- =DVAR(A3:C140,3,F3:H4)Sigma 10.67% <-- =DSTDEV(A3:C140,3,F3:H4) Date 01-Jan-05Criterion range (2 rows) 5. As a finance example, this is somewhat marred, since we have only 3 months in 2001. Advanced Use of the “D” Functions Suppose we want to know the statistics for Apple ’ s returns for a specific year.

We illustrate three techniques using the McDonald ’ s and Wendy ’ s data just discussed. 880 Chapter 33 Using Excel Functions The first technique involves the functions Slope , Intercept , and Rsq ; these functions give the parameters for a simple regression of the data in column B on column C. Using these numbers, the best linear explanation of the relation between the returns on WEN and MCD is: WEN MCD R =+ =0 0038 0 6381 13 11 2.. ,. % Using a Scatter Plot and Trendline Another way that we can produce a simple regression is to graph the data in a scatter chart and then use the Trendline function to compute the regression. • First plot the data using an XY Scatter Chart . • Click the data and then go to Add Trendline . The menu of regressions is given below the picture that follows this bullet. 1 2 3456789 1011121314151617181920212223242526 27 28AB C D EFG H I J K Date MCD WEN 1-Aug-05 4.01% -8.97% 1-Sep-05 3.14% -4.30% 3-Oct-05 -5.78% 3.42% 1-Nov-05 8.89% 8.71% 1-Dec-05 -0.36% 8.44% 3-Jan-06 3.76% 6.47% 1-Feb-06 -0.29% -1.52% 1-Mar-06 -1.60% 6.97% 3-Apr-06 0.62% -0.45% 1-May-06 -4.14% -2.20% 1-Jun-06 1.29% -3.35% 3-Jul-06 5.20% 3.17% 1-Aug-06 1.41% 6.29% 1-Sep-06 8.61% 4.74% 2-Oct-06 6.90% 9.76% 1-Nov-06 2.53% -5.79% 1-Dec-06 5.47% 1.59% Regression using functions 3-Jan-07 0.05% 2.58% Intercept 0.0038 <-- =INTERCEPT(C3:C26,B3:B26) 1-Feb-07 -1.50% -5.51% Slope 0.6381 <-- =SLOPE(C3:C26,B3:B26) 1-Mar-07 3.07% -2.38% R-squared 0.1311 <-- =RSQ(C3:C26,B3:B26) 2-Apr-07 6.92% 18.61% 1-May-07 4.59% 6.57% Note that 1-Jun-07 0.41% -8.80% Intercept 0.0038 <-- =AVERAGE(C3:C26)-F21*AVERAGE(B3:B26) 2-Jul-07 3.37% 1.11% Slope 0.6381 <-- =COVARIANCE.P( C3:C26,B3:B26)/VAR.P(B3:B26) 0.6381 <-- =COVARIANCE.S(C3 :C26,B3:B26)/VAR.S(B3:B26) R-squared 0.1311 <-- =C ORREL(C3:C26,B3:B26)^2REGRESSING WEN ON MCD -15%-10%-5%0%5%10%15%20% -8% -6% -4% -2% 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% WEN MCDXY Sca/g425er Chart: WEN vs MCD 881 Excel Functions Here ’ s the menu.

Highlighted cells correspond to the most important values produced in the previous example. 885 Excel Functions Index The discussion of the Index function belongs in the section on statistics only because we want to use it in our next subsection. We sometimes want to pick an individual value out of an array. In the example below, the range of cells A2:C4 contains a mixture of numbers and names. To pick out an individual item from this range, we use = Index(A2:C4,row,column) , where row and column are relative to the range itself. Thus “Howie” appears in row 2 and column 3 of the range A2:C4. 1 2 3 45 6AB C ab 3 Simon 6 Howie q 7 Jack Howie <-- =INDEX(A2:C4,2,3)USING THE INDEX FUNCTION In the next subsection we use the Index function to pick out a single item in the Linest array. Using Linest Excel has an array function Linest whose output consists of a number of regression statistics for an ordinary least squares regression. 7 Here is a picture of the spreadsheet and the Linest dialog box: 7. There is also an Excel function Logest , whose syntax is exactly the same as that of Linest . Logest calculates the parameters to fit an exponential curve. 886 Chapter 33 Linest is an array function (see next chapter), which means that instead of [Enter], we press [Control] + [Shift] + [Enter] at the same time. With the data from the example above, we can use Linest to produce the following output: 1 2 3 4 56 7 89 101112 13 1415 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 2728 29D C B A Observation X Y 8 9 . 0 1 3 . 5 3 1 3 1 . 1 1 7 . 9 2 2 1 5 . 2 1 8 . 0 3 3 4 . 8 8 . 8 5 4 7 2 . 9 4 . 1 6 5 3 7 . 8 3 . 1 7 6 6 3 . 6 4 . 4 7 7 5 . 8 7 . 6 7 8 2 8 . 7 7 . 0 7 9 4 1 . 9 5 . 7 5 0 1 slope intercept Slope (also =slope(C3:C12,B3:B12) )--> -0.0890 14.3285 <-- Intercept Standard error of slope --> 0.0148 0.8770 <-- Standard error of intercept R2 (also =Rsq(C3:C12,B3:B12) ) --> 0.8189 0.8117 <-- Standard error of y values (also =Steyx(C3:C12,B3:B12) ) F statistic --> 36.1825 8 <-- Degrees of freedom SSxy = Slope*(summed product of observations from means) --> 23.8377 5.2705 <-- SSE = Residual sum of squares Slope -0.0890 <-- =INDEX(LINEST(C3:C12,B3:B12,,1),1,1) Intercept 14.3285 <-- =INDEX(LINEST(C3:C12,B3:B12,,1),1,2) R20.8189 <-- =INDEX(LINEST(C3:C12,B3:B12,,1),3,1) t-statistic 16.3376 <-- =C23/INDEX(LINEST(C3:C12,B3:B12,,1),2,2) Slope -0.0890 <-- =INDEX(LINEST(C3:C12,B3:B12,,TRUE),1,1) Standard error of slope 0.0148 <-- =INDEX(LINEST(C3:C12,B3:B12,,TRUE),2,1) t-statistic -6.0152 <-- =C27/C28Linest outputUSING LINEST FOR A SIMPLE REGRESSION 887 Excel Functions Linest produces a block of output without column headers or row labels which identify the output. Excel ’ s Help provides a good explanation of the meaning of the output; in the above picture, we have added in the explanations. Note the syntax of this function: Linest(y-range,x-range,constant, statistics) . The y-range is the range of dependent variables and the x-range is the range of the independent variables. If constant is omitted (as in the case above) or set to True , then the regression is calculated normally; if constant is set to False , then the intercept is forced to be zero. If statistics is set to True (as in the case above), then the range of statistics is calculated; otherwise only the slope and intercept are calculated. Individual items of this output can be accessed by using the function Index discussed above. Suppose, for example, that we want to do a simple t -test on the slope; doing this requires us to divide the slope value by its standard error. 19 202122 23 24 25 26 2728 29 30 313233J I H G F E D C B A Linest output slope intercept Slope (also =slope(D4:D13,C4:C13) )--> -0.0890 14.3285 <-- Intercept Standard error of slope --> 0.0148 0.8770 <-- Standard error of intercept R 2 (also =Rsq(D4:D13,C4:C13) ) --> 0.8189 0.8117 <-- Standard error of y values (also =Steyx(D4:D13,C4:C13) ) F statistic --> 36.1825 8 <-- Degrees of freedom SSxy = Slope*(summed product of observations from means) --> 23.8377 5.2705 <-- SSE = Residual sum of squares Slope -0.0890 <-- =INDEX(LINEST(D4:D13,C4:C13,,1),1,1) Intercept 14.3285 <-- =INDEX(LINEST(D4:D13,C4:C13,,1),1,2) R20.8189 <-- =INDEX(LINEST(D4:D13,C4:C13,,1),3,1) Slope -0.0890 <-- =INDEX(LINEST(D4:D13,C4:C13,,TRUE),1,1) S.e. of slope 0.0148 <-- =INDEX(LINEST(D4:D13,C4:C13,,TRUE),2,1) t-statistic -6.0152 <-- =C31/C32 888 Chapter 33 1 23 456 7 89 1011 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24AB C D E F Observation X 1 X2 Y 1 35.3 81.2 10.98 2 29.7 22.5 11.13 3 30.8 77.3 12.51 4 58.8 34.8 8.4 5 61.4 55.1 9.27 6 71.3 124.8 8.73 7 74.4 18.5 6.36 8 76.7 234.6 8.5 9 70.7 22.5 7.82 10 57.5 123.3 9.14 x2coeff. x 1coeff. intercept Slope --> 0.0089 -0.0987 14.1705 <-- Intercept Standard error --> 0.0030 0.0110 0.6271 R2 --> 0.9196 0.5783 #N/A F statistic --> 40.0228 7.0000 #N/A SSxy --> 26.7674 2.3408 #N/A {=LINEST(E3:E12,C3:D12,,TRUE)}USING LINEST TO DO A MULTIPLE REGRESSION Multiple Regressions with Linest Linest can also be used to do a multiple regression, as illustrated below: 889 Excel Functions The predicted versus the actual Y ’ s are shown below: 33.7 Conditional Functions If , VLookup , and HLookup are three functions which allow you to put in conditional statements. The syntax of Excel ’ s If statement is If(condition,output if condition is true, output if condition is false) . In the example below, if the initial number is B3 < 3, then the desired output is 15. If B3 > 3, then the output is 0: 1 23 4 5 67 8 9 101112 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20AB C D E F G H I J K L M N Observation X 1 X2 Y d e t c i d e r P Y 3 C * 5 1 $ D $ + 3 D * 5 1 $ C $ + 5 1 $ E $ = - - < 1 7 0 4 . 1 1 8 9 . 0 1 2 . 1 8 3 . 5 3 1 4 9 3 4 . 1 1 3 1 . 1 1 5 . 2 2 7 . 9 2 2 6 6 1 8 . 1 1 1 5 . 2 1 3 . 7 7 8 . 0 3 3 0 7 7 6 . 8 4 . 8 8 . 4 3 8 . 8 5 4 4 0 0 6 . 8 7 2 . 9 1 . 5 5 4 . 1 6 5 3 1 4 2 . 8 3 7 . 8 8 . 4 2 1 3 . 1 7 6 2 3 9 9 . 6 6 3 . 6 5 . 8 1 4 . 4 7 7 7 1 8 6 . 8 5 . 8 6 . 4 3 2 7 . 6 7 8 7 3 9 3 . 7 2 8 . 7 5 . 2 2 7 . 0 7 9 7 9 8 5 . 9 4 1 . 9 3 . 3 2 1 5 . 7 5 0 1 x2 coeff. x 1 coeff. intercept Slope --> 0.0089 -0.0987 14.1705 <-- Intercept Standard error --> 0.0030 0.0110 0.6271 R2 --> 0.9196 0.5783 #N/A F statistic --> 40.0228 7.0000 #N/A SSxy --> 26.7674 2.3408 #N/A {=LINEST(E3:E12,C3:D12,,TRUE)}USING LINEST TO DO A MULTIPLE REGRESSION The regression equation is Y = 14.1705 - 0.0987*x 1 + 0.0089*x 2 The chart shows the predicted versus the actual Y.

Since VLookup , and HLookup both have the same structure, we will concentrate on VLookup and leave you to figure out 890 Chapter 33 HLookup for yourself. VLookup is a way to introduce a table search in your spreadsheet. Here is an example: Suppose the marginal tax rates on income are given by the table below (i.e., for income less than $8,000, the marginal tax rate is 0%; for income above $8,000, the marginal tax rate is 15%). Cell B9 illustrates how the function VLookup is used to look up the marginal tax rate. 1 2 3 45 6 78 9AB C IncomeTax rate 00 % 8,000 15% 14,000 25%25,000 38% Income 15,000Tax rate 25% <-- =VLOOKUP(B8,A3:B6,2)VLOOKUP FUNCTION The syntax of this function is VLookup(lookup_value,table,column) . The first column of the lookup table, A3:B6, must be arranged in ascending (increasing) order. The lookup_value , in this case the income of 15,000, is used to determine the applicable row of the table . The row is the first row whose value is < the lookup_value ; in this case, this is the row which starts with 14,000. The column entry determines from which column of the appli- cable row the answer is taken; in this case the marginal tax rates are in column 2. 33.8 Large and Rank, Percentile, and PercentRank Large(array, k) returns the k th largest number of the array , and Rank(number, array) returns the rank in array of number . Here is an example of each function: 891 Excel Functions Thus the third-largest number in the range A3:A12 is 10.98 and 9.27 is the fourth-largest number in the range A3:A12. If, as in cell B19, you specify an additional parameter in the function Rank , you will see that 9.27 is the sev- enth-ranking number from the bottom of the range A3:A12. As illustrated, Excel has similar functions for percentiles: Percentile and PercentRank . 33.9 Count, CountA, CountIf, CountIfs, AverageIf, AverageIfs As their names suggest, all six of these functions count: • Count : Counts the number of numeric entries in a range of cells. • CountA : Counts all the non-blank cells in a range. • CountIf : Counts cells which fulfill a specific condition. 1 2345 6 789 10111213141516171819 20 2122232425C B A Data 10.9811.1312.51 8.409.278.736.368.507.829.14 Ranking, k 3 K-th largest 10.98 <-- =LARGE(A3:A12,B14) Specific number 9.27 Rank from top 4 <-- =RANK(B17,A3:A12) Rank from bottom 7 <-- =RANK(B17,A3:A12,1) Percentile rank 0.8 Percentile 11.01 <-- =PERCENTILE(A3:A12,B21) Specific number 9.27 Percentile ranking 0.666 <-- =PERCENTRANK(A3:A12,B24)LARGE, RANK, PERCENTILE, PERCENTRANK 892 Chapter 33 • CountIfs : Counts cells depending on multiple conditions. • AverageIf and AverageIfs : Obvious.

This function and other text functions are discussed in Chapter 35. 893 Excel Functions count the number of returns above a certain level.

Cells G11 and G12 use CountIf to determine how many returns are below the upper bound in cell G8 and how many are above the lower bound in cell G9. But how many of the returns are between the two bounds? You can ’ t do it with CountIf , but we can do it (cell G14) with a trick involving Boolean functions: => < ↑SUMPRODUCT C :C G * C :C G Creates a vector of ’(( ) ( ) 42 7 9 42 7 8 1ss where the returns ar e lower bound G and 0’s where the re> ()9 tturns are upper bound G C: C G C:< >∗(), () (9 42 7 9 4/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext CCG Ditto Sumproduct mu ltiplies the t27 8< ↑ ↑))/dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/dncurlybracketright/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext wwo vectors and sums the results This gives the number of . ddata points between the two bounds./dncurlybracketleft/dncurlybracketmid/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext /dncurlybracketright /horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext/horizcurlybracketext /horizcurlybracketext A similar trick is employed in cell G15 to find the average of the returns which are between the two bounds: =>∗ < SUMPRODUCT C :C G C :C G C :C SUMPRODUCT C :(( ) ( ), ) ((42 7 9 42 7 8 42 7 4CCGC : CG C: C G C: C G Numerator Mu27 9 4 27 8 42 7 9 42 7 8>∗ < >∗ < =)( ) , () () ) :l ltiplies vector of ’s and ’s times the returns thus sum10 , ss the returns which are between the bounds Counts the retu rrns which are between the bounds This is all very tricky, but it is also very useful! 33.11 Offset The function Offset allows us to specify a cell or a block of cells in an array. It cannot be used by itself—rather, it must be part of another Excel function. The example below shows a large array of numbers. We want to sum a four-row, five-column array of the larger array (these numbers are specified in cells B6 and B7); as specified in cells B3 and B4, we want this summed array to start to the right and below the third row and the second column of the large block of numbers: 897 Excel Functions 1 2 34567 8 9 1011121314151617 18 1920212223242526 27 28293031AB C D E F G H Starting corner 3 n w o d s w o R Columns over 2 Range to be summed Number of rows 4 Number of columns 5 ) ) 7 B , 6 B , 4 B , 3 B , 1 3 H : 1 1 A ( T E S F F O ( M U S = - - < 1 1 8 m u S Check 811 <-- =SUM(C14:G17) 89 34 72 42 41 89 75 4133 6 49 7 62 50 38 1771 69 42 68 39 75 32 77 16 9 87 94 0 86 74 6 70 12 44 48 88 27 38 518 5 02 33 58 33 01 75 230 50 16 28 73 4 55 68 35 56 31 24 15 47 89 88 99 31 55 60 45 24 28 39 37 2 77 59 08 15 27 162 56 55 19 73 81 33 7687 27 80 38 65 61 38 6810 59 27 81 6 83 51 170 88 44 35 70 35 0 8298 45 17 45 89 19 58 4283 75 21 13 80 9 18 64 3 22 3 48 68 85 25 26 9 76 61 72 28 83 1 32 3864 87 32 67 50 73 19 8354 55 57 64 80 29 17 9212 95 66 59 48 78 87 23USING OFFSET The function OFFSET(A11:H31,B3,B4,B6,B7) in cell B8 specifies a block of cells within the range A11:H31. This range starts three rows below (the value in cell B3) and two columns to the right (the value in cell B4) of the top left-hand cell of the range A11:H31. The range itself is four rows deep (the value in cell B6) and five columns wide (the value in cell B7). The values in cells B6 and B7 always have to be positive, but the values in B3 and B4 can be negative as well as positive. In the example below the initial reference range is B22:H31, and Offset indicates a range which starts above this block of cells (since the value in B3 is negative): 898 Chapter 33 1 23 4 56789 101112 13 14151617181920 21 22 23242526272829 30 31 32AB C D E F G H I Starting corner 5 - n w o d s w o R Columns over 1 Range to be summed Number of rows 4 Number of columns 5 ( T E S F F O ( M U S = - - < 9 9 8 m uS B22:H31,B3,B4,B6,B7)) Check 899 <-- =SUM(C17:G20) 89 34 72 42 41 89 75 41 33 6 49 7 62 50 38 17 71 69 42 68 39 75 32 77 1 69 8 79 40 8 67 46 70 12 44 48 88 27 38 51 8 5 02 33 58 33 01 75 230 50 16 28 73 4 55 6835 56 31 24 15 47 89 8899 31 55 60 45 24 28 39 37 2 77 59 08 15 27 1 62 56 55 19 73 81 33 76 87 27 80 38 65 61 38 68 10 59 27 81 6 83 51 170 88 44 35 70 35 0 8298 45 17 45 89 19 58 4283 75 21 13 80 9 18 643 22 3 48 68 85 25 26 976 61 72 28 83 1 32 3864 87 32 67 50 73 19 83 54 55 57 64 80 29 17 92 12 95 66 59 48 78 87 23USING OFFSET with negative value For an innovative use of Offset , see Chapter 14, section 14.6. 3 4 Array Functions 34.1 Overview An Excel array function or formula performs an operation on a rectangular block of cells. In the simplest cases, built-in Excel array functions such as Transpose or MMult take an array and transpose it or take two matrices and multiply them. Once you get the hang of array functions, you can design your own array formulas. In this chapter, for example, we show how to use array formulas to find the minimum or maximum of the off-diagonal elements of a matrix or to pick out the diagonal of a matrix—all useful tricks to know when doing portfolio calculations such as those discussed in Chapters 8–13. The one critical thing to remember about array functions or formulas is that they are entered into a spreadsheet by pressing [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Enter] keys simultaneously; this contrasts with the usual procedure whereby we enter a function or formula only by pressing [Enter]. 34.2 Some Built-In Excel Array Functions In this section we discuss some built-in Excel array functions: Transpose , MMult , MInverse , and Frequency . Other functions are discussed elsewhere in this book—for example, the function Linest is discussed in Chapter 32. Transpose Suppose we ’ re trying to calculate the transpose of a 3 x 2 (3 rows, 2 columns) matrix that is in cells A2:B4 of the spreadsheet. 2 34AB 152637 Excel has a function called Transpose( ) , but, like all array functions, its use requires care: • Mark the target : Block off the cells D3:F4 into which you intend to put the transposed matrix. • Type the array function : Now type = Transpose(A2:B4) . This will appear in the top left-hand corner of the blocked-off cells. Of course you can use the 900 Chapter 34 usual tricks to show Excel which cells you want (e.g., pointing or using named ranges). At this point your spreadsheet looks like this: • [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Enter] : When you ’ ve finished typing the formula, don ’ t press [Enter] ! Instead, use [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Enter]. This will put the array function into all of the blocked-off cells. Here ’ s what the final product will look like: 1 2 3 4ABCDEF G 15 2 6 1 2 3 <-- {=TRANSPOSE(A2:B4)} 37 567USING TRANSPOSE Notice that the array function is surrounded by curly brackets { }. You don ’ t type these in—Excel puts these in automatically. 901 Array Functions This will transpose the range, but it will not link the original with the target range—when you change something in the original range, the target range is unchanged. The neat thing about the array function Transpose is that it ’ s a dynamic function , as are all the array functions and formulas: When you change one of the initial set of cells, the transposed array also changes. Paste|Paste Special|Transpose There is, of course, another way to transpose an array: You can copy the origi-nal array, and then use Paste|Paste Special to transpose the range, clicking on Transpose : 902 Chapter 34 MMult and MInverse—Multiplying and Inverting Matrices These two functions are used and explained in the portfolio chapters (8–13), so we only recapitulate briefly: • MMult(range1,range2) multiplies the matrix in range1 times that in range2 . Of course this is only possible if the number of columns in range1 equals the number of rows in range2 . • MInverse(range) calculates the inverse of the matrix in range . Note that range must be rectangular. Frequency The Excel array function Frequency(data_array,bins_array) calculates the frequency distribution of a data set. The spreadsheet below shows monthly return data for Ford stock over the period January 1977–December 2006. In column E we have put the bins, taking care that the first bin will be below the minimum monthly return over the period and that the last bin will be above the maximum monthly return. The range F8:F38 contains the array function Frequency (C4:C363,E8:E38) . From the output we can, for example, deduce that in the 20-year period there were two monthly returns between − 25.71% and − 23.71%, and 33 monthly returns between 4.29% and 6.29%. 1 2 3 45 6 78 9 1011 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 21 22 2324 25 2627 28 29 30 3132 33 3435 36 3738 39 40 41 4243 44 4546 47 48 49 5051 52 5354 55 5657 58 59 60 6162 63 6465 66 6768 69 70 71I H G F E D C B A DateFord stock priceMonthly return 3-Jan-77 0.50 1-Feb-77 0.48 -4.08% <-- =LN(B4/B3) Minimum -24.71% <-- =MIN(C4:C363) 1-Mar-77 0.45 -6.45% Maximum 32.48% <-- =MAX(C4:C363) 1-Apr-77 0.47 4.35% 2-May-77 0.46 -2.15% Bin Frequency } ) 8 3 E : 8 E , 3 6 3 C : 4 C ( Y C N E U Q E R F = { - - < 0 % 1 7 . 5 2 - % 4 3 . 8 0 5 . 0 7 7 - n u J - 1 2 % 1 7 . 3 2 - % 8 0 . 4 - 8 4 . 0 7 7 - l u J - 1 1 % 1 7 . 1 2 - % 1 1 . 2 - 7 4 . 0 7 7 - g u A - 1 2 % 1 7 . 9 1 - % 9 1 . 6 0 5 . 0 7 7 - p e S - 1 6 % 1 7 . 7 1 - % 9 1 . 6 - 7 4 . 0 7 7 - t c O - 3 3 % 1 7 . 5 1 - % 1 1 . 2 8 4 . 0 7 7 - v o N - 1 5 % 1 7 . 3 1 - % 8 0 . 4 0 5 . 0 7 7 - c e D - 1 8 % 1 7 . 1 1 - % 9 1 . 6 - 7 4 . 0 8 7 - n a J - 3 0 1 % 1 7 . 9 - % 0 0 . 0 7 4 . 0 8 7 - b e F - 1 8 1 % 1 7 . 7 - % 7 1 . 8 1 5 . 0 8 7 - r a M - 1 3 2 % 1 7 . 5 - % 6 8 . 2 1 8 5 . 0 8 7 - r p A - 3 6 2 % 1 7 . 3 - % 1 5 . 3 - 6 5 . 0 8 7 - y a M - 1 5 3 % 1 7 . 1 - % 1 5 . 5 - 3 5 . 0 8 7 - n u J - 1 5 3 % 9 2 . 0 % 0 0 . 0 3 5 . 0 8 7 - l u J - 3 7 3 % 9 2 . 2 % 5 8 . 3 - 1 5 . 0 8 7 - g u A - 1 0 3 % 9 2 . 4 % 5 8 . 3 3 5 . 0 8 7 - p e S - 1 3 3 % 9 2 . 6 % 1 9 . 9 - 8 4 . 0 8 7 - t c O - 2 2 2 % 9 2 . 8 % 6 0 . 2 9 4 . 0 8 7 - v o N - 1 1 2 % 9 2 . 0 1 % 2 0 . 2 0 5 . 0 8 7 - c e D - 1 9 % 9 2 . 2 1 % 0 0 . 0 0 5 . 0 9 7 - n a J - 2 3 1 % 9 2 . 4 1 % 0 0 . 0 0 5 . 0 9 7 - b e F - 1 5 % 9 2 . 6 1 % 3 8 . 5 3 5 . 0 9 7 - r a M - 1 4 % 9 2 . 8 1 % 0 7 . 3 5 5 . 0 9 7 - r p A - 2 5 % 9 2 . 0 2 % 0 7 . 3 - 3 5 . 0 9 7 - y a M - 1 2 % 9 2 . 2 2 % 0 0 . 0 3 5 . 0 9 7 - n u J - 1 1 % 9 2 . 4 2 % 0 0 . 0 3 5 . 0 9 7 - l u J - 2 1 % 9 2 . 6 2 % 0 7 . 3 5 5 . 0 9 7 - g u A - 1 0 % 9 2 . 8 2 % 0 8 . 1 6 5 . 0 9 7 - p e S - 4 2 % 9 2 . 0 3 % 2 4 . 5 1 - 8 4 . 0 9 7 - t c O - 1 0 % 9 2 . 2 3 % 3 2 . 8 1 - 0 4 . 0 9 7 - v o N - 1 1 % 9 2 . 4 3 % 8 8 . 4 2 4 . 0 9 7 - c e D - 3 2-Jan-80 0.45 6.90% 1-Feb-80 0.41 -9.31% 3-Mar-80 0.39 -5.00% 1-Apr-80 0.34 -13.72% 1-May-80 0.34 0.00% 2-Jun-80 0.34 0.00% 1-Jul-80 0.40 16.25% 1-Aug-80 0.39 -2.53%2-Sep-80 0.39 0.00% 1-Oct-80 0.37 -5.26% 3-Nov-80 0.32 -14.52% 1-Dec-80 0.29 -9.84% 2-Jan-81 0.29 0.00% 2-Feb-81 0.29 0.00% 2-Mar-81 0.35 18.81% 1-Apr-81 0.32 -8.96% 1-May-81 0.34 6.06% 1-Jun-81 0.35 2.90% 1-Jul-81 0.32 -8.96% 3-Aug-81 0.30 -6.45%1-Sep-81 0.30 0.00% 1-Oct-81 0.25 -18.23% 2-Nov-81 0.25 0.00% 1-Dec-81 0.25 0.00% 4-Jan-82 0.28 11.33% 1-Feb-82 0.29 3.51%1-Mar-82 0.32 9.84% 1-Apr-82 0.34 6.06% 3-May-82 0.35 2.90% 1-Jun-82 0.37 5.56% 1-Jul-82 0.34 -8.46% 2-Aug-82 0.42 21.13% 1-Sep-82 0.39 -7.41%THE FREQUENCY ARRAY FUNCTION Frequency Distribution of Ford Returns Jan 1977 - Dec 2006 2126 3581018232635 3537 3033 2221 913 545 21102 01 0510152025303540-25.7% - -23.7%-23.7% - -21.7%-21.7% - -19.7%-19.7% - -17.7%-17.7% - -15.7%-15.7% - -13.7%-13.7% - -11.7%-11.7% - -9.7%-9.7% - -7.7%-7.7% - -5.7%-5.7% - -3.7%-3.7% - -1.7%-1.7% - 0.3%0.3% - 2.3%2.3% - 4.3%4.3% - 6.3%6.3% - 8.3%8.3% - 10.3%10.3% - 12.3%12.3% - 14.3%14.3% - 16.3%16.3% - 18.3%18.3% - 20.3%20.3% - 22.3%22.3% - 24.3%24.3% - 26.3%26.3% - 28.3%28.3% - 30.3%30.3% - 32.3%32.3% - 34.3% 904 Chapter 34 34.3 Homemade Array Functions In our experience array functions often arise out of situations where you are called upon to do long, repetitive calculations. You then discover that the same calculation can be done in a single array function. In many cases it is not clear why a particular array technique should work. For example, in this chapter we will use the fact that A3 + B6:B8 adds the contents of cell A3 to each of cells B6:B8. Why? Heaven only knows! We also use the (undocumented, as far as we are aware) trick that B3:B7 ∧ A3:A7 raises cell B3 to the power A3, cell B4 to the power A4, … . In this section we illustrate homemade array functions with two examples having to do with investment returns. Computing the Compound Annual Return from 10 Years of Return Data The table below gives the annual returns for the Harvard University endowment. You are asked to compute the compound annual return over the 10-year period. Assuming that the returns have been discretely computed (meaning that rEndowment value Endowment valuet tt t== −111 0 ,, ,… ), you realize that the compounded annual return is rr r r=+() ∗+() ∗+() () − 11 1 1 2002 2003 201111 0…/ .

Computing Discount Factors with an Array Function We are given a set of interest rates r 1 , r 2 , … , and we want to compute the formula 1 11+()=∑rtt tn . Excel ’ s NPV function won ’ t work for this, so we ’ ll have to build our own function.

Writing (1 + B3:B7) ∧ A3:A7) adds 1 to each of cells B3:B7 and raises the result to the power in cells A3:A7. Applying Sum gives the result (of course, this being an array function, you have to enter it with [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Enter]). An alternative, given in rows 13–17, is to build the result recursively. This gives the same result, but with more work. 907 Array Functions 34.4 Array Formulas with Matrices In this section we create some array functions that have to do with matrices. Subtracting a Constant from a Matrix In the portfolio computations of Chapters 8–13, we often have to subtract a constant from a matrix. This is easy to do with an array formula, entered with [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Enter]. 1 2345678 9 10 11121314ABCDE 1 6 Constant 3 26384951 0 -2 3-1 3 <-- {=A3:B7-E3} 051627Matrix SUBTRACTING A CONSTANT FROM A MATRIX Matrix minus constant Creating a Matrix with Ones on the Diagonal and Zeros Elsewhere This is a problem that comes up in Chapter 10: We want a matrix which has a diagonal of 1 ’ s, but has zero off-diagonal elements. The spreadsheet below shows three ways of doing this: 908 Chapter 3 4 The first an d secon d met hods rely on t he labeling of the rows an d the columns. In the first example, the formula =IF(B3:E3 =A4:A7,1,0 )tests whether the row label equa ls the column heading; if this is true, we put a 1 in the cell, and otherwise we put in a 0. In t he secon d examp le we use an If function w ith mixed absolute an d relative re ferences to create t he same e ffect. In the third examp le, there are no co lumn or row labels, an d we re ly on t he functions Colum nand Rowto test t he equa lity of the relative row an d column places in the matr ix. Finding the Max imum and M inimum Off-Diagonal Elements o f a Matr ix We want to find the max imal and minimal elements o f the off-diagonal ele- ments o f a matr ix.

We can then use Max and Min to determine the extreme off-diagonal elements. As shown in rows 20–29, we could also have used the non-array formula = IF(B$3 = $A4,””,B4) in cell B11 and copied it to the rest of the matrix. We can also find the maximum and minimum by incorporating the array formula directly into the Max and Min : 910 Chapter 34 Replacing the Off-Diagonals Using VLookup Now suppose that we want to replace the off-diagonal elements using a lookup table, as illustrated below: 1 2 3 45 6 789 10AB C D E F A BCD A 10 2 3 4 B -3 20 4 -3 C 15 6 06 D 42 - 1 0 2 5 Max of off-diagonals 6 <-- {=MAX(IF(B3:E3=A4:A7,\"\",B4:E7))} Min of off-diagonals -10 <-- {=MIN(IF(B3:E3=A4:A7,\"\",B4:E7))}FINDING THE MAX,MIN OF OFF-DIAGONAL ELEMENTS OF A MATRIX in one step The source matrix 1 234567 8 9 10111213 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2122F E D C B A ABCD A 1 0234B- 3 2 0 4- 3 C15 6 06D42 - 1 0 2 5 Lookup table for replacements -10 i -6 ii -2 iii 2i v 6v 10 vi ABCD A 10 iv iv iv <-- =IF(E$3=$A4,E4,VLOOKUP(E4,$A$10:$B$15,2)) Bi i 2 0 i v i i Ci i i i v 6 0 v Di v i v i 2 5REPLACING THE MAX,MIN OF OFF-DIAGONAL ELEMENTS OF A MATRIX long way, non-array formulas Range below contains non-array formula =IF(B$3=$A4,B4,VLOOKUP(B4,$A$10:$B$15,2)), which has been copied to all the cellsThe source matrix 911 Array Functions Array formulas can simplify this procedure: 1 23456789 1011121314 15 16 17 1819202122F E D C B A A BCD A 1 0234 B -3 20 4 -3 C 15 6 06 D 42 - 1 0 2 5 Lookup table for replacements -10 i -6 ii -2 iii 2i v 6v 10 vi A BCD A 10 iv iv iv <-- {=IF(B3:E3=A4:A7,B4:E7,VLOOKUP(B4:E7,A10:B15,2))} B ii 20 iv ii C iii iv 60 v D iv iv i 25REPLACING THE MAX,MIN OF OFF-DIAGONAL ELEMENTS OF A MATRIX Using array formula Range below contains array formula =IF(B3:E3=A4:A7,B4:E7,VLOOKUP(B4:E7,A10:B15,2))The source matrix Exercises 1.

Compute the discrete annual returns for each fund and then use an array function to compute the compound annual return over the period. Recall that discretely compounded, the return in year t is ( Fund value t / Fund value t − 1 ) − 1. If the returns were continuously compounded, then the year- t return would be ln( Fund value t / Fund value t − 1 ) . 1 2 34 5 6 7ABCDEFG GE MSFT JNJ K B A IBM GE 0.1035 0.0758 0.0222 -0.0043 0.0857 0.1414 MSFT 0.0758 0.1657 0.0412 -0.0052 0.0379 0.1400 JNJ 0.0222 0.0412 0.0360 0.0181 0.0101 0.0455 K -0.0043 -0.0052 0.0181 0.0570 -0.0076 0.0122 BA 0.0857 0.0379 0.0101 -0.0076 0.0896 0.0856 IBM 0.1414 0.1400 0.0455 0.0122 0.0856 0.2993 3 5 Some Excel Hints 35.1 Overview This chapter covers a grab bag of Excel hints dealing with problems and needs that we sometimes run into. The chapter makes no pretence at uniformity or extensiveness of coverage. Topics covered include: • Fast fills and copy • Graph titles that change when data changes • Creating multi-line cells (useful for putting line breaks in cells and linked graph titles) • Typing Greek symbols • Typing sub- and superscripts (but not both) • Naming cells • Hiding cells • Formula auditing • Writing on multiple spreadsheets • Using Excel ’ s personal notebook to copy and paste and format quickly 35.2 Fast Copy: Filling in Data Next to Filled-In Column Usually, we copy cells by dragging on the fill handle of the cell with the formula. There is sometimes an easier method. Consider the following situation: 1 2 34 5 678 9AB C 12 2 5 <-- =B2+33 4 567 8AUTO FILL/COPY 914 Chapter 35 Now double-click on “fill handle” (shown below with the cross). After double- clicking, the range B2:B9 will automatically fill with the formula in B3. Here ’ s the result: 1 2 34 5 6 78 9 10 11ABC 12 25 < - - = B 2 + 3 3841 1 51 4 61 7 72 082 3AUTO FILL/COPY Double-clicking on the \"fill handle\" of a cell will fill in the rest of the column provided there's a filled cell next to it. 915 Some Excel Hints 35.3 Filling Cells with a Series Sometimes we want to fill a set of cells with a series. This can be accomplished by going to Editing|Fill|Series on the Home tab: Here ’ s an example. Starting with cell A1, we want to fill a column with cells increasing by 3 until we get to 16: 916 Chapter 35 Clicking OK gives 1 234 5 6A 147 10 13 16 This interesting command has several other options which we leave for you to try. 35.4 Multi-Line Cells It is sometimes useful to put a line break in a cell, thus creating a multi-line cell. Do this with [Alt] + [Enter] where you want a line break. 1 2A PUTTING LINE BREAKS IN CELLS This is a multi-line cell. The break was entered by inserting [Alt]+[Enter] at the first break point. There are, of course other ways to make a cell multi-lined. The most obvious is to use the Wrap text box in the Format Cells|Alignment command: 917 Some Excel Hints Here ’ s the cell after we word-wrap it. (Note that in the dialog box above we ’ ve also set the vertical alignment of the cell to Center .) 1A The line in this cell runs over into neighboring cells, but by using Home|Number|Alignment we can word wrap the cell. 35.5 Multi-Line Cells with Text Formulas Sometimes you want to put a line break in a cell which has text formulas in it. In the example below, the text formula in cell A4 combines the text in cells A1 and A2. 918 Chapter 35 1 234 5B A Simon JackSimonJack <-- =A1&A2 SimonJack <-- =A1&CHAR(10)&A2, not correctly formatted Simon Jack <-- =A1&CHAR(10)&A2, pushed the Wrap Text on the Home tab We can put a line break into the text formula by doing two things: • Put Char(10) between A1 and A2—that is, write the formula = A1&Char(10)&A2 into the cell. Char(10) is the code for a hard line return. • Push Word Wrap on the Home tab. Now you will have a break between the contents of the two cells at the point you entered Char(10) . 35.6 Writing on Multiple Spreadsheets This Excel trick enables you to write in multiple spreadsheets at the same time. First: Hold down [Shift] and indicate several spreadsheet tabs by clicking on them. In the example below we ’ ve clicked on the tabs labeled Spreadsheet1 , Spreadsheet2 , Spreadsheet3 . Now—whatever you write on one sheet will be written on all three. 919 Some Excel Hints Now anything we write in one of the sheets is also written in the same cells of all the others, so that we can produce three identical spreadsheets: 35.7 Moving Multiple Sheets of an Excel Notebook We write on multiple sheets by holding down [Shift] and marking the tabs of the relevant spreadsheets. A similar trick works to move multiple sheets of the same Excel notebook: • Mark the multiple sheets by holding down [Shift] and clicking on the appro- priate sheets. • Now use Edit|Move or copy sheet to move or copy the sheets to another location on the same spreadsheet or to a different spreadsheet. 920 Chapter 35 35.8 Text Functions in Excel The Text function lets you change numbers to text. Here are some examples: 1 2 3456789 10C B A Income 15,000 Tax rate 35% Taxes owed 5,250 <-- =B3*B2 Tax rate as text 35.00% <-- =TEXT(B3,\"0.00%\") 0.4 <-- =TEXT(B3,\"0.0\") Income as date Jan. 24, 1941 <-- =TEXT(B2,\"mmm. dd, yyyy\")TEXT FUNCTIONS Note that you can choose different ways of formatting the cell B3 in text form—in cell B7 we have formatted the tax rate as a percentage with two decimal points, whereas in cell B8 we have formatted the tax rate as one decimal, causing it to be rounded off. Note also the somewhat stupid example in cell B10: Since dates in Excel are just numbers that express the number of days from 1 January 1900, we can express the income of $15,000 in cell B2 as a date. In the next section we use text functions to create chart titles that update themselves. 35.9 Chart Titles That Update You want to have the chart title change when a parameter on the spreadsheet changes. For example, in the next spreadsheet, you want the chart title to indicate the growth rate. 921 Some Excel Hints 1 2 3456789 10111213141516171819 20 2122ABCDEFGH I Growth 15% Year Cash flow 1 100.002 115.00 <-- =B5*(1+$B$2)3 132.25 <-- =B6*(1+$B$2)4 152.095 174.90 Cash Flow Growth Rate = 15.0%CHART TITLES THAT UPDATE AUTOMATICALLY Chart title below contains the text function =\"Cash Flow Growth Rate = \"&TEXT(B2,\"0.0%\")050100150200 12345Cash ﬂow YearCash Flow Growth Rate = 15.0% Once we have completed the necessary steps, changing the growth rate will change both the graph and its title: 922 Chapter 35 To make graph titles update automatically, carry out the following steps: • Create the graph you want in the format you want it. Give the graph a “proxy title.” (It makes no difference what; you ’ re going to eliminate it soon.) At this stage your graph might look like: 1 2 3456789 10111213141516171819ABCDEFGH I Growth 5% Year Cash flow 1 100.002 105.00 <-- =B5*(1+$B$2)3 110.25 <-- =B6*(1+$B$2)4 115.765 121.55CHART TITLES THAT UPDATE AUTOMATICALLY 050100150 12345Cash ﬂow YearCash Flow Growth Rate = 5.0% 923 Some Excel Hints 1 2 3 4 56 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 1516 17 1819 20 21 22ABCDEFGH I Growth 12% Year Cash flow 11 0 0 . 0 0 2 112.00 <-- =B5*(1+$B$2) 31 2 5 . 4 4 41 4 0 . 4 9 51 5 7 . 3 5 61 7 6 . 2 371 9 7 . 3 8 Cash Flow Graph When Growth = 12.0%CHART TITLES THAT UPDATE AUTOMATICALLY Chart title below contains text function =\"Cash Flow Graph When Growth = \"&TEXT(B2,\"0.0%\")asdfasdf 050100150200250 1234567 YearCash flow • Create the title you want in a cell. In the example above, cell D22 contains the formula: = “Cash Flow Graph When Growth = “ &TEXT(B2,”0.0% ”) • Click on the graph title to mark it, and then go to the formula bar and insert an equal sign to indicate a formula. Then point at cell D22 with the formula and click [Enter]. In the picture below, you see the chart title highlighted and in the formula bar “ = Changing graph titles!$D$22” indicating the title of the graph. 924 Chapter 35 35.10 Putting Greek Symbols in Cells How do we type Greek letters in a spreadsheet? 1 2 34 5AB Initial stock price 30 Mean, 15% Standard deviation, 20% Delta, t 0.004GREEK AND SYMBOLS IN CELLS μ Δσ This is fairly simple, if you know the Greek equivalents for the Greek letters (for example, μ and σ are lowercase “m” and “s,” respectively, Σ and Δ are uppercase “S” and “D”). For example, we first typed “Delta, Dt” into cell A5 and then marked the “D” in the formula bar: 925 Some Excel Hints We then changed the font from Arial to Symbol: Pressing [Enter] produces the desired result. 35.11 Superscripts and Subscripts It is not a problem to type subscripts or superscripts in Excel. Enter text into a cell, and then mark the letters you want to turn into a subscript or superscript: Now go to Format Cells and check the Superscript box: 926 Chapter 35 Here ’ s the result: 1 2 3 4AB x2 x2 iCannot put superscript and subscript one above the othe rSUPERSCRIPTS/SUBSCRIPTS IN CELLS As you can see in cell A4 above, you cannot put a subscript and a superscript on the same letter. That is, you cannot create xi2 . 35.12 Named Cells It is sometimes useful to give a name to a cell. Here ’ s an example: 927 Some Excel Hints 1 2 34AB C Income 15,000Tax rate 33%Tax paid 4,950 <-- =B3*B2NAMED CELLS We want to refer to cell B3 by the name “tax.” To do this, we mark the cell and then go to the name tab on the toolbar: Typing in the word “tax” on the highlighted B3 allows us to reference B3 by this name anywhere in the Excel notebook: 1 2 34AB C Income 15,000Tax rate 33%Tax paid 4,950 <-- =tax*B2NAMED CELLS Sometimes Excel lets us use cell names without ever actually going through the procedure just described. In the next example, Excel lets us use the column headers as cell names: 7 89AB C D Sales Margin Profit 1000 20% 200 <-- =Sales*Margin 5000 30% 1500 <-- =Sales*Margin To manage the named cells, go to the Name Manager on the Formulas tab: 928 Chapter 35 35.13 Hiding Cells (in Data Tables and Other Places) In this text, we have often hidden the cell contents of data table headers. Here ’ s a simple data table (this topic is discussed in detail in Chapter 31): 1 2 3 4 56 7 89 101112 13 141516D C B A Payment 100 Number of payments 15 Discount rate 15% Present value $584.74 <-- =PV(B4,B3,-B2) PV of payments Data table 584.74 <-- =B5 , data table header 0% 1,500.00 3% 1,193.79 6% 971.22 9% 806.07 12% 681.09 15% 584.74 18% 509.16 21% 448.90HIDING CELLS The data table header in cell C8 is necessary for the table to work, but it is ugly and may be confusing if the table is copied into other documents. To hide the contents of C8, mark the cell and go to the Format Cells menu (or click on the right mouse button): 929 Some Excel Hints In the Number|Custom|Type box we have put in a semicolon. This pre- serves the cell contents but prevents them from being seen. Now when you copy the cells, this is the way they will appear: 7 8 9 10111213 14 1516D C B PV of payments <-- =B5 , data table header 0% 1,500.00 3% 1,193.79 6% 971.22 9% 806.07 12% 681.09 15% 584.74 18% 509.16 21% 448.90 930 Chapter 35 Note the comment in cell D8: We advise you always to annotate your spreadsheet, so that when you come back to it after a few weeks/months, you will know that cell C8 really does have something in it! One final note: To hide a cell which contains a reference to another cell containing a formula, three semicolons (;;; ) may be necessary. In the spread-sheet below, cell B4 contains the function IF . Cell B6 refers to this cell. To hide B6, we use three semicolons instead of one in the Format Cells|Number|Custom|Type. (If there ’ s logic here, it escapes us!) 1 234 5 6AB C 3 3 a 8 bc bbb <-- =IF(B2+B3<15,\"aaa\",\"bbb\") Cell to be hidden --> <-- =B4HIDING A CELL WHICH REFERS TO A FORMULA 35.14 Formula Auditing Excel can tell you where you ’ ve used a cell in your formulas and which cells a particular formula depends on. Clicking on Tools|Formula Auditing brings up a menu which allows you to do this: 931 Some Excel Hints Here ’ s the result: 1 2 34 5 67 8 9 1011 12 1314 15AB C D E F G Loan principal 10,000 Interest rate 7% Loan term 6 <-- Number of years over which loan is repaid Annual payment 2,097.96 <-- =PMT(B3,B4,-B2) Split payment into: YearPrincipal at beginning of yearPayment at end of year InterestReturn of principal 1 10,000.00 2,097.96 700.00 1,397.96 2 8,602.04 2,097.96 602.14 1,495.823 7,106.23 2,097.96 497.44 1,600.52 4 5,505.70 2,097.96 385.40 1,712.56 5 3,793.15 2,097.96 265.52 1,832.446 1,960.71 2,097.96 137.25 1,960.71 70 .00FLAT PAYMENT SCHEDULES =$B$3*C9 =D9-E9 =C9-F9 932 Chapter 35 In a similar way we can check to see which cells are precedents of a par- ticular cell: 1 2 34 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1213 14 15AB C D E F G Loan principal 10,000 Interest rate 7% Loan term 6 <-- Number of years over which loan is repaid Annual payment 2,097.96 <-- =PMT(B3,B4,-B2) Split payment into: YearPrincipal at beginning of yearPayment at end of year InterestReturn of principal 1 10,000.00 2,097.96 700.00 1,397.96 2 8,602.04 2,097.96 602.14 1,495.82 3 7,106.23 2,097.96 497.44 1,600.52 4 5,505.70 2,097.96 385.40 1,712.56 5 3,793.15 2,097.96 265.52 1,832.44 6 1,960.71 2,097.96 137.25 1,960.71 7 0.00FLAT PAYMENT SCHEDULES =$B$3*C9 =D9-E9 =C9-F9 Formula auditing can help you implement a general rule of good spreadsheet writing: You should try to avoid cells which don ’ t have either precedents or dependents. 35.15 Formatting Millions as Thousands By using Format Cells|Custom you can change millions into thousands. To see where this is handy, consider the following income statement: 1 2 345678AB Sales 31,235,689 Cost of goods sold 15,250,888 Sales, general, and administrative 2,356,188Interest 1,999,824 Profits before taxes 11,628,789 Taxes 4,418,940 Profits after taxes 7,209,849INCOME STATEMENT 933 Some Excel Hints We want to make the income statement appear in thousands (in other words, instead of 31,235,689 we will see 31,236. Here ’ s how this can be done: In the Type box we have indicated #,###, . The comma at the end indicates that we want Excel to drop the last three digits in the number (and round the number), and the #,### indicates that we want the remaining numbers to appear with a comma. This is merely a formatting change—the actual numbers are not changed: In cell B10 in the output below, we ’ ve multiplied the Sales by 2; the result is 62,471,378. Adding another comma to the Type box (that is, #,###,, ) will drop another three digits. 934 Chapter 35 1 2 345 6 789 10AB C 6 3 2 , 1 3 s e l a S Cost of goods sold 15,251 Sales, general, and administrative 2,356 0 0 0 , 2 t s e r e t n I Profits before taxes 11,629 9 1 4 , 4 s e x a T 0 1 2 , 7 s e x a t r e t f a s t i f o r P The cells retain their values 62,471,378 <-- =B2*2INCOME STATEMENT 35.16 Excel ’ s Personal Notebook: Automating Frequent Procedures Excel ’ s personal notebook allows you to save macros and procedures that only you can access. We give two examples of such procedures: • We explain Excel ’ s Copy as Picture feature and show how to attach this to a macro stored in your personal notebook. This greatly simplifies copying from Excel and pasting into Microsoft Word (all the copy/pastes in this book were made this way). • We explain how to save number formatting in the personal notebook. Using the Copy as Picture Feature of Excel 1 Excel 2010 and 2013 contain a very nice way to copy from Excel as a picture. This is useful for embedding pictures of Excel spreadsheets into Word without a link. Here ’ s the way it works: 1. In Excel indicate the selection you want to copy: 1. This section applies to Excel 2010 and 2013, but not to previous versions. 935 Some Excel Hints 2. On the Home tab go to Copy|Copy as Picture: 3. Indicate As shown when printed : 4. You can now go to Microsoft Word and Copy and Paste. The result: You get a picture without any Excel link. 2 3 45 6ABC D E F s n a e M x i r t a m e c n a i r a v o c - e c n a i r a V 0.2000 -0.0200 0.0250 -0.0080 3% -0.0200 0.3000 0.0600 0.0030 2% 0.0250 0.0600 0.4000 0.0000 8% -0.0080 0.0030 0.0000 0.5000 4% 936 Chapter 35 Automating the Procedure We want to automate this procedure: • Turn it into a macro. • Attach a key sequence (in this case, [Ctrl] + q) to the macro. • Make the macro and key sequence available in all your Excel spreadsheets. To do this, you have to create a Personal.xlsb file. This file is hidden but activates each time you start Excel. It ’ s yours only—other readers of your spreadsheets won ’ t see it. Here are the steps: • Activate the Developer tab on the menu bar. • Use Record Macro to save a macro as a personal notebook. • Edit the personal notebook with what you want. Activate the Developer Tab Go to File|Options|Customize Ribbon and activate the Developer tab as shown below: 937 Some Excel Hints 938 Chapter 35 Use Record Macro The Developer tab allows you to record a macro and save it as part of the Personal.xlsb notebook. We will illustrate with the copy as picture feature. 1. Open a blank Excel notebook and click on the Developer tab and then on Record Macro : Excel will ask for details of the recording. Here ’ s what I wrote. Note that I ’ m saving this as a Personal Macro Workbook and that I ’ m using the shortcut keystrokes [Ctrl] + q: 2. Now go to the Home tab, mark an area of the spreadsheet, and go through the whole Copy as Picture feature: 939 Some Excel Hints 3. Go back to the Developer tab and stop the recording: 4. Close down Excel. Excel will ask you if you want to save the Personal notebook. The answer is, of course, positive: 940 Chapter 35 This creates the following file (“simon benninga” is of course my user name on my computer—you will substitute your user name): C:\\Users\\simonbenninga\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Excel\\XLSTART\\ PERSONAL.XLSB Edit the Personal Notebook Now that you ’ ve saved the Personal.xlsb file, you may want to edit it. Open any Excel file, hit [Alt] + [F11] to go the VBA editor. Note that the Personal file is also there: Range(“C3:G10”) : Sub Macro1() ‘ ‘ Macro1 Macro ‘ Copy as picture ‘ ‘ Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl + q Selection.CopyPicture Appearance: = xlPrinter, _ Format: = xlPicture End Sub We have edited this by deleting the line Range(“C3:G10”).Select . The resulting macro is given below. 941 Some Excel Hints Using the Macro From now on, whenever you open a file on your computer , you can use [Ctrl] + q to copy a region as a picture. Note that this feature works only on your computer—it ’ s in your personal notebook. Quick Number Formatting We often want to format numbers with comma separators and without deci-mals. For example: 1 2AB 1356.001 1987.398 3387.3 4458.98 To make the formatting of these numbers uniform: • Mark the numbers. • Go to the appropriate formatting command and then press [Enter]. 942 Chapter 35 The result: 1 2AB 1,356 1,9873,387 4,459 By using the same routine as for Copy and Paste as Picture above, we can generate a macro in our personal notebook. We have assigned [Ctrl] + w to this macro: Sub Commas() ‘ Commas Macro ‘ Keyboard Shortcut: Ctrl + w Selection.NumberFormat = “#,##0” End Sub VISUAL BASIC FOR APPLICATIONS (VBA) Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is the programming language attached to Excel. VBA is very functional and flexible. Because of its ready integration with Excel worksheets, VBA is widely used in the financial community. VBA incorporates many features that are part of standard programming languages, and it is not difficult to master if you have some programming experience. You do not need to be proficient in VBA to understand Sections I–VI of Financial Modeling . These sections can be understood without anything more than the very rudimentary VBA principles incorporated in the preface to this book (or alternatively in the small file called “Adding Getformula to your Spreadsheet” that is part of the disk that comes with the book). The four chapters of this section cover Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) topics for the reader interested in developing his or her own programs. Chapter 36 shows how to write functions that can be added in to Excel spreadsheets. Financial Modeling uses many of these “homemade” functions. Examples are the two-stage Gordon model (Chapter 3), Black-Scholes pricing of options (Chapter 17), and derivation of the Nelson-Siegel term structure (Chapter 22). Chapter 37 discusses more advanced topics related to variables and arrays in VBA. We have used this topic in fixing the bugs in Excel ’ s XNPV and XIRR functions (Chapter 1). Chapter 38 shows how to build subroutines in VBA. A subroutine is not a function, but rather an automation of some repeti-tive action. Financial Modeling uses subroutines in a number of places—for example, in computing the efficient frontier without short sales (Chapter 12). Finally, Chapter 39 discusses objects and add-ins. Among other topics dis- cussed in this chapter is the creation of user-defined add-ins in Excel. VII 3 6 User-Defined Functions with VBA 36.1 Overview Chapters 36–39 discuss the uses of Excel ’ s programming language, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). VBA provides a complete programming lan-guage and environment fully integrated with Excel and all other Microsoft Office applications. In this chapter we introduce user-defined functions, which are used in various places in this book. The examples and screen shots depict the Excel 2013 working environment but are fully compatible (unless otherwise noted) with all versions of Excel using Visual Basic for Applications (Version 5 and above). 36.2 Using the VBA Editor to Build a User-Defined Function Throughout this book we have used VBA to define functions that are not included in Excel. One example is the function Getformula that is attached to all the spreadsheets in this book; another example is the function that com-putes the Black-Scholes option value (Chapter 17). In this section we show you how to build a user-defined function. A user function is a saved list of instructions for Excel that produces a value. Once defined, a user function can be used inside an Excel worksheet like any other function. 1 1. User-defined functions are usually attached to a specific workbook and are only available if that workbook is currently open in Excel. If you want a macro to be available whenever you use Excel on a specific computer save it in the Personal Macro Workbook ; see Chapter 35, section16. Another way of having access to a VBA function across worksheets is to put it in an add-in; see Chapter 39 for an introduction to add-ins in Excel. 946 Chapter 36 In this section we will write our first user-defined function. Before you can do this, you need to activate the VBA editor. You can do this either by using the keyboard shortcut [Alt] + F11 or from the Excel ribbon ( Developer Tab|Visual Basic Editor ). By default, Excel doesn ’ t display the Developer tab on the Excel ribbon. To show the Developer tab, go to File|Options| Customize the Ribbon and indicate Developer : 947 User-Defined Functions with VBA The result in both cases is a new window like the following screen shot (your window may look slightly different, but it will be functionally equivalent). 948 Chapter 36 We are now ready to write our first function. This function (named “ plus ”) will add together two numbers. A user-defined function in Excel has three obligatory elements: 1. A header line with the name of the function and a list of parameters. 2. A closing line (usually inserted by VBA). 3. Some program lines between the header and the closing line. Start writing the first line of the function: function plus (parameter1,parameter2) A user-defined function needs to be written in a module. To open a new module, select Insert|Module from the menu in the VBA editor environment. This will open a new window, as illustrated in the next screen shot: 949 User-Defined Functions with VBA As soon as you end the line with a tap on the Enter key, VBA will do a cleanup job. The color of all the words that VBA recognizes as part of its programming language (“reserved words”) will change. All reserved words will be capitalized. A space will be added after the comma separating the first parameter from the second parameter. The closing line for the function will be inserted, and the cursor will be in position between the header and the closing line ready for you to go on typing. 950 Chapter 36 Function plus(parameter1, parameter2) plus = parameter1 + parameter2 End Function We are now ready to type our function line. This is the line that makes our function do something. 2 Our first function will take two variables and return their sum: 2. The indentation of lines in VBA code, which we added manually, is not required by VBA but makes reading the code much easier. You can now use this function in your spreadsheet: 1 2 34AB C Parameter1 3.25 Parameter2 1.5Plus 4.75 <-- =plus(B2,B3)PLUS IN ACTION 951 User-Defined Functions with VBA The fastest way to insert a function (assuming you know its name) is to start typing the name. When the suggested list of names narrows down, select the appropriate function name from the list: 952 Chapter 36 You can also use the function in the Excel Function Wizard. Clicking on this icon on the toolbar will produce the following screen: 953 User-Defined Functions with VBA Selecting User Defined from the pull-down menu will present the following screen listing all user-defined functions; one of them should be the function we have just added, plus : 954 Chapter 36 When you select plus and click OK, you will see that Excel treats this like any other function, bringing up a dialogue box that asks for the location or value of parameter1 and parameter2 : Notice that at this point there is no explanation or help for the function. The next section provides part of the remedy. 955 User-Defined Functions with VBA 36.3 Providing Help for User-Defined Functions in the Function Wizard Excel ’ s Function Wizard (shown below) provides a short help line (an explana- tion of what the function does). Here ’ s how Excel explains its own functions in the Function Wizard: 956 Chapter 36 Click in the Macro name box, and type the name of the function (notice that you don ’ t see the function name in the macro dialogue box above … you have to type it in): To attach a text description to our function, activate the macro selection box. You can do this either from the Excel ribbon ( Developer|Macros ) or by using the keyboard shortcut [Alt] + F8. 957 User-Defined Functions with VBA Click on the Options button: 958 Chapter 36 Type the description in the Description box. Click OK , and close the macro selection box. Our function now has a help line. Excel functions have help lines attached to each of the parameters and a help file entry. We can supply the same for our function; sadly, the subject is beyond the scope of this introduction. 36.4 Saving Excel Workbook with VBA Content At some point in the process, you need to save your work. 3 Starting with Excel 2007, an Excel workbook with VBA content has to be saved as a “macro-enabled file.” When you first try to save a workbook with VBA content, Excel will present you with the following message: 3. We suggest soon and often. 959 User-Defined Functions with VBA You should choose No and get the Save As dialog to enable you to choose a new file type. 960 Chapter 36 Now open the circled selection, select the second option, xlsm , and save the workbook. If you use VBA often, then you might consider changing the default Excel file type to xlsm . 4 36.5 Fixing Mistakes in VBA Once you start using VBA, you ’ re sure to make mistakes. In this section we illustrate several typical mistakes and help you correct them. This list is not meant to be exhaustive—we have selected mistakes typically made by VBA beginners. Mistake 1: Using the Wrong Syntax Suppose that in writing Plus you forget the “ + ” between parameter1 and parameter2 (recall that the function is supposed to return parameter1 + parameter2 ). Once you hit the Enter key, you get the following error message: 4. The command is File|Options|Save|Save files in this format . Clicking the OK button corrects this problem. 961 User-Defined Functions with VBA Mistake 2: Right Syntax with a Typing Error It ’ s easy to make typing errors that will only be detected once you try to use the function. In the example below, we define two functions— function1 and function2 . Unfortunately, the program line for function2 mistakenly calls the function “function1”: The VBA editor does not immediately recognize this mistake. The mistake will pop up when you try to use the function in a worksheet. Excel will notify you that you ’ ve made a mistake and take you to the VBA editor: If you recognize your mistake, you can correct it. You can also try to go to the VBA help by clicking Help (in many cases this will lead to an incompre- hensibly complicated explanation). 962 Chapter 36 Suppose you recognize your mistake. You click OK , and get ready to correct the error by replacing the word “Function1” with “Function2.” At this point your screen looks like this: Notice: A. The word [break] in the title bar. B. The offending symbol is selected. C. The function line is highlighted and pointed to by an arrow in the margin. Because VBA found an error while trying to execute the function, it moved into a special execution mode called debug-break mode. For now all we need to do is get out of this special mode so we can get on with our work. We do this by clicking the icon on the VBA toolbar. Now you can fix the function and use it. We can (and should) have VBA check the module for errors before trying to use the functions in the module. From the VBA menu we select Debug|Compile VBAproject ; this will find the first error in the module and point it out as before but without going into debug-break mode. 963 User-Defined Functions with VBA 36.6 Conditional Execution: Using If Statements in VBA Functions In this section we explore the If statements available to you in VBA. Not all things in life are linear, and sometimes decisions have to be made. If state- ments are one way of doing this in VBA The One-Line If Statement The one-line If statement is the simplest way to control the execution of a VBA function: One statement is executed if a condition is true and another is executed if a condition is not true. The complete condition and its statement should be on one line. Here ’ s an example: Function OneLineIf(Parameter) If Parameter > 5 Then OneLineIf = 1 Else OneLineIf = 15 End Function We can now use the function OneLineIf in Excel. When Parameter is > 5, OneLineIf returns 1 and when Parameter is < 5, OneLineIf returns 15. 1 2 3 4AB C Parameter 12 1 <-- =OneLineIf(A3) 3 15 <-- =OneLineIf(A4)ONELINEIF IN ACTION The one-line If statement doesn ’ t even need the Else part. The function below, OneLineIf2 , returns 0 if the condition “Parameter > 5” is not fulfilled: Function OneLineIf2(Parameter) If Parameter > 5 Then OneLineIf = 1 End Function 964 Chapter 36 Good Programming Practice: Assign a Value to Your Function First In the above functions, it would be good programming practice to first assign a value to the function before introducing the If statement. This way we know that OneLineIf3 defaults to − 16 if the condition on Parameter is not fulfilled. 6 7 89AB C Parameter 12 1 <-- =OneLineIf2(A8) 3 0 <-- =OneLineIf2(A9)ONELINEIF2 IN ACTION Function OneLineIf3(Parameter) OneLineIf3 = -16 If Parameter > 5 Then OneLineIf3 = 1 End Function To see the difference this makes, look at the spreadsheet below: 11 12 1314AB C Parameter 12 1 <-- =OneLineIf3(A13) 3 -16 <-- =OneLineIf3(A14)ONELINEIF3 IN ACTION If … ElseIf Statements If more than one statement is to be conditionally executed, the block If… ElseIf statement can be used. It uses the following syntax: If Condition0 Then Statements ElseIf Condition1 Then Statements 965 User-Defined Functions with VBA [… More ElseIfs …] Else Statements End If The Else and ElseIf clauses are both optional. You may have as many ElseIf clauses as you want following an If, but none can appear after an Else clause. If statements can be contained within one another. Here ’ s an example: Function BlockIf(Parameter) If Parameter < 0 Then BlockIf = -1 ElseIf Parameter = 0 Then BlockIf = 0 Else BlockIf = 1 End If End Function Here ’ s how this function works in Excel: 23 24 252627AB C Parameter -3 -1 <-- =BlockIf(A25) 0 0 <-- =BlockIf(A26) 13 1 <-- =BlockIf(A27)BLOCKIF IN ACTION Nested If Structures As stated in the previous section, If statements can be used as part of the statements used in another If statement. A program structure that has some If statements inside others is called a nested If structure. Each If statement in the structure must be a complete If statement. Either the one-line or the block version can be used. 966 Chapter 36 The following function demonstrates the use of the NestedIf structure: Function NestedIf(P1, P2) If P1 > 10 Then If P2 > 5 Then NestedIf = 1 Else NestedIf = 2 ElseIf P1 < -10 Then If P2 > 5 Then NestedIf = 3 Else NestedIf = 4 End If Else If P2 > 5 Then If P1 = P2 Then NestedIf = 5 Else NestedIf = 6 Else NestedIf = 7 End If End If End Function This is how it looks in Excel: 30 31 32 33 34 35 3637AB C D 11 6 1 <-- =NestedIf(A31,B31) 22 3 2 <-- =NestedIf(A32,B32) -22 6 3 <-- =NestedIf(A33,B33) -57.3 4 4 <-- =NestedIf(A34,B34) 66 5 <-- =NestedIf(A35,B35) -5 7 6 <-- =NestedIf(A36,B36) 43 7 <-- =NestedIf(A37,B37)NESTEDIF IN ACTION 967 User-Defined Functions with VBA 36.7 The Boolean and Comparison Operators The expressions used as conditions in an If statement are also known as Boolean expressions. Boolean expressions can have one of two values: TRUE when the condition holds, and FALSE when the condition is violated. Usually Boolean expressions are constructed using the Comparison and/or Boolean operators. The following is a list of the most common Comparison operators. Operator Meaning < Less than < = Less than or equal to > Greater than > = Greater than or equal to = Equal to < > Not equal to The And Boolean Operator The next function uses a Boolean operator to check whether two conditions hold at the same time. Function AndDemo(parameter1, parameter2) If (parameter1 < 10) And (parameter2 > 15) _ Then AndDemo = 3 Else AndDemo = 12 End If End Function 968 Chapter 36 Here are some illustrations: 1 2 34 5 6AB C D parameter1 parameter2 9 14 12 <-- =AndDemo(A3,B3) 9 16 3 <-- =AndDemo(A4,B4) 11 14 12 <-- =AndDemo(A5,B5)11 16 12 <-- =AndDemo(A6,B6)ANDDEMO IN ACTION Notice what AndDemo does: It checks both conditions (parameter1 < 10) and (parameter2 > 15). If both conditions hold, then the combined conditions hold and the function returns a value of 3. Otherwise (i.e., if either one of the conditions is violated) it returns 12. (Note that both conditions are in parentheses.) The following function and screen shot demonstrate all four possible com- binations of two conditions and the resulting combined condition: Function AndTable(parameter1, parameter2) AndDemoTable = parameter1 And parameter2 End Function 1 2 3456AB C D parameter1 parameter2 9 14 12 <-- =AndDemo(A3,B3) 9 16 3 <-- =AndDemo(A4,B4) 11 14 12 <-- =AndDemo(A5,B5) 11 16 12 <-- =AndDemo(A6,B6)ANDDEMO IN ACTION 969 User-Defined Functions with VBA The Or Boolean Operator The function OrDemo , illustrated below, checks whether at least one of two conditions holds: Function OrDemo(parameter1, parameter2) If (parameter1 < 10) Or (parameter2 > 15) _ Then OrDemo = 3 Else OrDemo = 12 End If End Function Notice what OrDemo does: It checks whether either the first condition (Parameter1 < 10) or the second condition (Parameter2 > 15) or both conditions hold. Only if both conditions are violated will the function return a value of 12. Otherwise (i.e., if either one or both of the conditions hold) it returns 3. (Note that both conditions are in parentheses.) The following function and the screen shot demonstrate all four possible combinations of two conditions and the resulting combined condition: 18 19 2021 22 23AB C D parameter1 parameter2 9 14 3 <-- =OrDemo(A20,B20) 9 16 3 <-- =OrDemo(A21,B21) 11 14 12 <-- =OrDemo(A22,B22)11 16 3 <-- =OrDemo(A23,B23)ORDEMO IN ACTION Function OrDemoTable(parameter1, parameter2) OrDemoTable = parameter1 Or parameter2 End Function 970 Chapter 36 36.8 Loops Looping structures are used when you need to do something repeatedly. As always there is more than one way to achieve the desired effect. In general there are two major looping constructs: • A top-checking loop : The loop condition is checked before anything else gets done. The something to be done can be left undone if the condition is not fulfilled on entry to the loop. • A bottom-checking loop : The loop condition is checked after the something to be done is done. The something to be done will always be done at least once. VBA has the two major looping structures covered from all possible angles by the Do statement and its variations. All the following subsections will use a version of the factorial function for demonstration purposes. The function used is defined as: fff f f n n f n() () ( ) () ( ) ( )01 11 22 12 1 === ∗ = = ∗ − … 1 2 3 456AB C D parameter1 parameter2 FALSE FALSE FALSE <-- =ORDemoTable(A3,B3)FALSE TRUE TRUE <-- =ORDemoTable(A4,B4) TRUE FALSE TRUE <-- =ORDemoTable(A5,B5) TRUE TRUE TRUE <-- =ORDemoTable(A6,B6)ORTABLE IN ACTION 971 User-Defined Functions with VBA Function DoWhileDemo(N) If N < 2 Then DoWhileDemo = 1 Else i = 1 j = 1 Do While i < = N j = j * i i = i + 1 Loop DoWhileDemo = j End If End Function 1 2 3 4AB C 5 120 <-- =DoWhileDemo(A2) 9 362880 <-- =DoWhileDemo(A3) 13 6227020800 <-- =DoWhileDemo(A4)DOWHILEDEMO IN ACTION The Do While Statement The Do While statement is a member of the top-checking loops family. It makes VBA execute one or more statements zero or more times, while a condition is true. The following function demonstrates this behavior: 972 Chapter 36 The Do … Loop While Statement The Do … Loop While statement is a member of the bottom-checking loops family. It makes VBA execute one or more statements one or more times, while a condition is true. The following function demonstrates this behavior: Function DoLoopWhileDemo(N) If N < 2 Then DoLoopWhileDemo = 1 Else i = 1 j = 1 Do j = j * i i = i + 1 Loop While i < = N DoLoopWhileDemo = j End If End Function 1 2 34C B A 5 120 <-- =DoLoopWhileDemo(A2) 9 362880 <-- =DoLoopWhileDemo(A3) 13 6227020800 <-- =DoLoopWhileDemo(A4)DOLOOPWHILEDEMO IN ACTION 973 User-Defined Functions with VBA The Do Until Statement The Do Until statement is a member of the top-checking loops family. It makes VBA execute one or more statements zero or more times, until a condi- tion is met. The following function demonstrates this behavior: Function DoUntilDemo(N) If N < 2 Then DoUntilDemo = 1 Else i = 1 j = 1 Do Until i > N j = j * i i = i + 1 Loop DoUntilDemo = j End If End Function 1 2 34AB C 5 120 <-- =DoUntilDemo(A2) 9 362880 <-- =DoUntilDemo(A3) 13 6227020800 <-- =DoUntilDemo(A4)DOUNTILDEMO IN ACTION 974 Chapter 36 The Do … Loop Until Statement The Do … Loop Until statement is a member of the bottom-checking loops family. It makes VBA execute one or more statements one or more times, until a condition becomes true. The following function demonstrates this behavior: Function DoLoopUntilDemo(N) If N < 2 Then DoLoopUntilDemo = 1 Else i = 1 j = 1 Do j = j * i i = i + 1 Loop Until i > N DoLoopUntilDemo = j End If End Function 1 2 34C B A 5 120 <-- =DoLoopUntilDemo(A2) 9 362880 <-- =DoLoopUntilDemo(A3) 13 6227020800 <-- =DoLoopUntilDemo(A4)DOLOOPUNTILDEMO IN ACTION 975 User-Defined Functions with VBA The For Loop One last (for now) variation on the loopy theme, the For loop, is used mainly for loops where the number of times the action is repeated is known in advance. The following functions demonstrate its use and variations: Function ForDemo1(N) If N < = 1 Then ForDemo1 = 1 Else j = 1 For i = 1 To N Step 1 j = j * i Next i ForDemo1 = j End If End Function The Step part of the statement can be dropped if (as is in our case) the increment is 1. For example: 1 2 34AB C 5 120 <-- =ForDemo1(A2) 9 362880 <-- =ForDemo1(A3) 13 6227020800 <-- =ForDemo1(A4)FORDEMO1 IN ACTION For i = 1 To N j = j * i Next i 976 Chapter 36 If you want the loop to count down, the Step argument can be negative, as demonstrated in the next function: Function ForDemo2(N) If N < = 1 Then ForDemo2 = 1 Else j = 1 For i = N To 1 Step -1 j = j * i Next i ForDemo2 = j End If End Function The For loop can be exited early by using the Exit For statement as demon- strated in the next function (not the factorial function). 1 2 34AB C 5 120 <-- =ForDemo2(A2) 9 362880 <-- =ForDemo2(A3) 13 6227020800 <-- =ForDemo2(A4)FORDEMO2 IN ACTION Function ExitForDemo(Parameter1, Parameter2) Sum = 0 For i = 1 To Parameter1 Sum = Sum + i If Sum > Parameter2 Then Exit For Next i ExitForDemo = Sum End Function 977 User-Defined Functions with VBA 36.9 Using Excel Functions in VBA VBA can use most of Excel ’ s worksheet functions. We illustrate by showing how to define the binomial distribution (even though this, itself, is an Excel function). The probability distribution of a binomial random variable is defined as Binom p n xn xpp x nx,,() =⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ − ()−1 where p is the probability of success; x is the number of successes, and n is the number of trials. n xn nx x⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟=− ()! !! is the binomial coefficient, which gives the number of ways of choosing x elements from among n elements. For example, suppose you want to form a two-person team from eight candidates and you want to know how many possible teams can be formed. The answer is given by 8 28 6287654321 654321 2128⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟==⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅ ⋅⋅⋅⋅⋅∗⋅=! !! . The Excel function Combin (8, 2) does this calculation. We use this Excel function in the following VBA function: 1 2 3 4 5 6AB C D Parameter1 Parameter2 5 22 15 <-- =ExitForDemo(A3,B3) 6 22 21 <-- =ExitForDemo(A4,B4) 7 22 28 <-- =ExitForDemo(A5,B5) 8 22 28 <-- =ExitForDemo(A6,B6)EXITFORDEMO IN ACTION Function Binomial(p, n, x) Binomial = Application.WorksheetFunction. _ Combin(n, x) * p ∧ x * (1 - p) ∧ (n - x) End Function 978 Chapter 36 As usual, this can be applied inside a spreadsheet: 1 2 3 4 5C B A p0 .5 n1 0 x6 Binomial 0.20507813 <-- =Binomial(B2,B3,B4) BINOMIAL IN ACTION Note that we used Application.WorksheetFunction.Combin(n, x) to compute n x⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ in our function. As you might guess from its name ( Application. WorksheetFunction.Something ), this function is the Excel Worksheet func- tion Combin( ) . Most, but not all, 5 Excel worksheet functions can be used in VBA in exactly the same way. For a complete list see the Help file. One more thing to notice is the underscore (_) preceded by a space at the end of line 2. If a line gets too long to deal with, it can be continued on the next line using this contraption (the second and third lines of Binomial are one line as far as VBA is concerned). 6 Suppose we try to use our Binomial function to calculate Binomial (0.5,10,15) . This won ’ t work: 1 2 34 5C B A p0 .5 n1 0 x1 5 Binomial #VALUE! <-- =Binomial(B2,B3,B4) BINOMIAL IN ACTION 5. When an equivalent function is available as a native VBA function, the corresponding Excel function is not available in VBA. For example, in VBA use rnd( ) and not Application. WorksheetFunction.Rand() and sqr( ) and not Application.WorksheetFunction.Sqrt( ) . 6. What ’ s too long? This is a matter of programming taste, but for our purposes any line over 70–80 characters is considered too long 979 User-Defined Functions with VBA The reason for the problem is that in the computation n x⎛ ⎝⎜⎞⎠⎟ used in Binomial , we have to have x < n . In this case, VBA causes Excel to return the error message #V ALUE! . The subject of Excel error values is somewhat obscure and is discussed in the Appendix to this chapter. 36.10 Using User-Defined Functions in User-Defined Functions User-defined functions can be used in other user-defined functions, just like Excel functions. The next function is a replacement for the COMBIN worksheet function. COMBIN is defined as cnxn nx x,! !!() =−() where ! stands for the factorial function. (Recall that the factorial function n! is defined for any n > 0: 0! = 1, and for n > 0, n! = n *( n − 1)*( n − 2) … 1.) We will now write our VBA version of the two functions: the factorial func- tion and the COMBIN function. 1 Function HomeFactorial(n) 2 If Int(n) < > n Then 3 HomeFactorial = CVErr(xlErrValue) 4 ElseIf n < 0 Then 5 HomeFactorial = CVErr(xlErrNum) 6 ElseIf n = 0 Then 7 HomeFactorial = 1 8 Else 9 HomeFactorial = HomeFactorial(n - 1) * n 10 End If 11 End Function Line 2 checks if the input is an integer by comparing the integer part of “n” to “n.” The function “Int” is a part of VBA. If we have erred, for example, by 980 Chapter 36 asking for HomeFactorial(3.3) , then line 3 of the program will cause Excel to return #V ALUE! . Similarly, lines 4 and 5 check if we have improperly asked for HomeFactorial of a negative number; if this is the case, then line 5 causes Excel to return #NUM! . For a fuller explanation of the use of error values, see the Appendix to this chapter. Line 9 introduces a new concept; the function uses itself to calculate the value it should return. This is called recursion. Here ’ s an illustration of the function in action: 1 2 3 4 5 6AB C D E 1 1 <-- 1 1 <-- =HomeFactorial(A2) 2 2 <-- =B2*A3 2 <-- =HomeFactorial(A3) 3 6 <-- =B3*A4 6 <-- =HomeFactorial(A4)4 24 <-- =B4*A5 24 <-- =HomeFactorial(A5) 5 120 <-- =B5*A6 120 <-- =HomeFactorial(A6) RECURSION IN ACTION We can now use HomeFactorial to create our VBA version of Combin (which we will call HomeCombin ): Function HomeCombin(n, x) HomeCombin = HomeFactorial(n) / _ (HomeFactorial(n - x) * HomeFactorial(x)) End Function 981 User-Defined Functions with VBA Finally, we can use HomeCombin to create a VBA version of the binomial function: Function HomeBinom(p, n, x) If n < 0 Then HomeBinom = CVErr(xlErrValue) ‘Make the function ‘return #VALUE! ElseIf x > n Or x < 0 Then HomeBinom = CVErr(xlErrNum) ‘Make the function ‘return #NUM! Else HomeBinom = HomeCombin(n, x) _ * p ∧ x * p ∧ (n - x) End If End Function Putting Comments in VBA Code As illustrated above, VBA will ignore anything on a line which follows an apostrophe (note that each new line of comments has to begin with an apostrophe.

A bank offers different yearly interest rates to its customers based on the size of the deposit in the following way: • For deposits up to 1,000, the interest rate is 5.5% • For deposits from 1,000 and up to 10,000, the interest rate is 6.3% • For deposits from 10,000 and up to 100,000, the interest rate is 7.3% • For all other deposits the interest rate is 7.8% Implement the function Interest(Deposit) in VBA.

An investment company offers a bond linked to the FT100 index. On redemption the bond pays the face value plus the largest of A: the face value times the change in the index. Or B: 5% yearly interest compounded monthly.

A bank offers the following saving scheme: Invest a fixed amount on the first of each month for a set number of years. On the first of the month after your last installment, you get your money plus the accrued interest. The bank quotes a yearly interest rate but interest is calculated and compounded on a monthly basis. Eight different interest rates are offered depending on the monthly deposit and the number of years the program is to run. The following table lists the interest rates offered. For sums < = 100 a monthFor sums > 100 a month For a period of 2 years 3.5% 3.9% For a period of 3 years 3.7% 4.5% For a period of 4 years 4.2% 5.1% For a period of 5 years 4.6% 5.6% Write a two-argument function DFV(Deposit, Years) , returning the future value of such an investment. 1 2 3 4 56 7AB C D Deposit Years DFV 10 5 675.7458 <-- =DFV(A3,B3)10 4 523.5107 <-- =DFV(A4,B4) 10 3 381.2934 <-- =DFV(A5,B5)10 2 248.9488 <-- =DFV(A6,B6) 10 1 120 <-- =DFV(A7,B7)Exercise 8 985 User-Defined Functions with VBA 9.

Fibonacci numbers are named after Leonardo Fibonacci (1170–1230), an outstanding European mathematician of the medieval period. Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: F FFF FFF FFF F()() ()00 11 201 131 2 242 3= = ()=+ ()= ()=()+()= ()=()+()= =3 … In general Fn Fn Fn()=−() +−() 21 .

The CVErr( ) function is part of VBA. It converts a value, supplied by you, to the special kind of value used for errors in Excel. Excel has a number of error values that a function can return to signal that something went wrong. Here ’ s an example: The function NewMistake(x,y) returns the result x / y . However, if y = 0, the function outputs the (cryptic) error message #DIV0!. Function NewMistake(x, y) If y < > 0 Then NewMistake = x / y Else _ NewMistake = CVErr(xlErrDiv0) End Function To Anticipate Future Confusion All the VBA error values are written “xlErr … .” Because the typed alphabet letter “l” also looks like the number one, it would have been easier had Microsoft used capital letters “XLErr … .” But … 987 User-Defined Functions with VBA This is NewMistake in Excel: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7AB C D X Y NewMistake 1 2 0.5 <-- =NewMistake(A4,B4) 2 1 2 <-- =NewMistake( A5,B5) 0 1 0 <-- =NewMistake(A6,B6) 1 0 #DIV/0! <-- =NewMistake( A7,B7)NewMistake In Action Error values and their explanation are listed below. Error Value VBA Name Possible causes #NULL! XlErrNull The #NULL! error value occurs when you specify an intersection of two areas that do not intersect. #DIV/0! XlErrDiv0 The #DIV/0! error value occurs when a formula divides by 0 (zero). #V ALUE! XlErrValue The #V ALUE! error value occurs when the wrong type of argument is used. #REF! XlErrRef The #REF! error value occurs when a cell reference is not valid. #NAME? XlErrName The #NAME? error value occurs when Microsoft Excel doesn ’ t recognize text in a formula. #NUM! XlErrNum The #NUM! error value occurs when a problem occurs with a number in a formula or function. #N/A XlErrNA The #N/A error value occurs when a value is not available to a function or formula. 3 7 Variables and Arrays 37.1 Overview In the first part of this chapter we introduce function variable definitions. The second part of the chapter introduces arrays. An array is a group of variables of the same type sharing the same name and referenced individually using an index. Vectors and matrices are good examples of one- and two-dimensional arrays. The relationship between arrays and worksheet ranges opens the dis-cussion, followed by sections describing simple and dynamic arrays (whose size can be changed at run time). The chapter concludes with sections on the use of arrays as parameters and a short discussion of typed variables. 37.2 Defining Function Variables Function variables are used to store values. Function variables can be either parameter or simple variables. Parameters are defined when the function is defined by listing them within parentheses after the function ’ s name. Up until now we used simple variables as and when needed, relying on VBA to define the variable for us when it was first used. In most scenarios encountered in this book, this practice is good enough, and it has the advantage of being quick. The first time we encountered both flavors of function variables was in the function DoWhileDemo : Function DoWhileDemo(N) If N < 2 Then DoWhileDemo = 1 Else i = 1 ‘ A Loop counter j = 1 ‘ An accumulator for the series Do While i < = N j = j * i i = i + 1 Loop DoWhileDemo = j End If End Function 990 Chapter 37 The variable N is a parameter that gets its value from the application that activates the function (either Excel or another function). The variables i, j are simple variables. Function variables (aka internal or local variables) of both types are recognized only in the function in which they were defined (implic-itly or explicitly) and are not recognized by Excel or by other VBA functions. As this is a very short function, there really is no reason to define the vari- ables explicitly and the addition of comments makes everything clear enough. Longer functions with more variables might benefit by defining the variables at the top of the function, as it makes for more maintainable, and clear pro-gramming. Simple variables are defined using the Dim statement as demon- strated by the following function: Function NewDoWhileDemo(N) Dim i ‘ a Loop counter Dim j ‘ An accumulator for the series If N < 2 Then NewDoWhileDemo = 1 Else i = 1 j = 1 Do While i < = N j = j * i i = i + 1 Loop NewDoWhileDemo = j End If End Function The Option Explicit Statement We can make VBA alert us if we use an undeclared variable by inserting the Option Explicit statement as the first line in the module. With this statement any use of an undeclared variable will result in an error and not the creation of a new variable. The Option Explicit statement holds for all the routines in the module. 991 Variables and Arrays Forcing the definition of variables can help prevent errors from creeping into your functions. Here is an (slightly forced) example: The following func- tion contains a typing error (“Temp” is spelled “Remp”): Function Typo(Parameter) Remp = Parameter * 3 + 1 Typo = Temp End Function Without the Option Explicit statement, Excel merrily displays the follow- ing result: However, inserting the Option Explicit statement before the VBA code and recalculating the worksheet results in the following “Run Time Error”: 1 2AB C 5 0 <-- =Typo(A2)TYPO IN ACTION 992 Chapter 37 Once we are alerted to the problem, we can click the OK button, stop VBA from running, and fix the problem by replacing “Remp” with “Temp.” (Recall from Chapter 36 that after you fix the mistake in VBA, you have to press the button on the VBA editor toolbar.) 37.3 Arrays and Excel Ranges A VBA array is a group of variables of the same type sharing the same name and referenced individually using an index (or indices). VBA has its own version of arrays and we shall deal with this type of array in the following sections. For now let us demonstrate the Variant . If we want a function to accept an Excel range as a parameter we have to leave the parameter type-less, or declare the parameter as Variant (which amounts to the same thing). From inside the function the variable looks like an array. To demonstrate, we shall now write a small function, SumRange , that sums the value in the first four elements of its parameter. Function SumRange(R) S = 0 For i = 1 To 4 S = R(i) + S Next i SumRange = S End Function 1 2 3 4 5 6AB 1< - - 1 2< - - 2 3< - - 3 4< - - 4 10 <-- =SumRange(A2:A5)SUMRANGE IN ACTION 1 23ABC D 12 34 10 <-- =SumRange(A2:D2)SUMRANGE IN ACTION 993 Variables and Arrays In both cases the variable R can be treated as an array, with the first element being R(1) and the last element R(4) . Each of the elements can be treated as a single variable, that is, R(2) is a variable and so is R(i-3) (assuming that i-3 has an integer value > = 1 and < = 4). Ranges treated as arrays always start with index 1. What happens if the range passed to our function is rectangular? To dem- onstrate, we introduce a modified version of SumRange , inserting a second parameter that tells the function how many elements to sum. Function SumRange1(R, N) S = 0 For i = 1 To N S = R(i) + S Next i SumRange = S End Function As we can see, VBA treats the rectangular array as a linear array composed of the rows of the original range. The second parameter of the function SumRange1 indicates how many elements should be summed. Thus, for example, Sumrange1(A2:C4,5) sums the first row plus two cells in the second row. A Payback Period Function A slightly more complex use of ranges can be shown with a simple Payback Period function. Recall that the payback period in capital budgeting refers to 1 2 3 4 5 67ABCD 345 678 91 01 1 18 <-- =SumRange1(A2:C4,4)25 <-- =SumRange1(A2:C4,5)33 <-- =SumRange1(A2:C4,6)SUMRANGE1 IN ACTION 994 Chapter 37 the period of time required for the return on an investment to “repay” the sum of the original investment. For example, a $1,000 investment which pays cash flows of $500 per year has a 2-year payback period. To simplify matters, the function PayBack defined below gives a whole year solution. If the sum of the cash flows for 5 years is < 0 and for 6 years is > 0, then the function will return 6. We also assume that the first cash flow is the initial investment (nega-tive) and that no other cash flows are negative. Function PayBack(R, N) Temp = 0 For i = 1 To N Temp = Temp + R(i) If Temp > = 0 Then Exit For Next i PayBack = i - 1 End Function 1 234AB C D E F P e r i o d 12345Cash-flow -1500 400 600 600 300PayBack 3 <-- =PayBack(B3:F3,5)PAYBACK IN ACTION There are a few problems with this function as currently defined. One is that the function returns a wrong answer if the investment does not pay back its initial outlay, as demonstrated by the next screen shot. 1 234AB C D E F P e r i o d 12345Cash-flow -4000 400 600 600 300PayBack 5 <-- =PayBack(B3:F3,5)PAYBACK IN ACTION 995 Variables and Arrays The problem is solved by inserting a check before returning the payback period. Function PayBack1(r, n) Temp = 0 For i = 1 To n Temp = Temp + r(i) If Temp > = 0 Then Exit For Next i If Temp > = 0 Then PayBack1 = i - 1 Else PayBack1 = “No Payback” End If End Function 37.4 Simple VBA Arrays There are several ways to declare VBA arrays, all using the Dim statement. The simplest way to declare an array is simply to tell VBA the largest value the array index can take. Unless you indicate otherwise, VBA arrays always start with index 0. In the function below, MyArray has 6 elements numbered 0, 1, 2, … , 5. 1 234AB C D E F P e r i o d 12345Cash-flow -4000 400 600 600 300PayBack No Payback <-- =PayBack1(B3:F3,5)PAYBACK1 IN ACTION 996 Chapter 37 Function ArrayDemo1() Dim MyArray(5) For i = 0 To 5 MyArray(i) = i * i Next i S = “” For i = 0 To 5 S = S & “ # “ & MyArray(i) Next i ArrayDemo1 = S End Function If you use ArrayDemo1 in a spreadsheet, here is the result: 1 2B A # 0 # 1 # 4 # 9 # 16 # 25 <-- =ArrayDemo1()ARRAYDEMO1 IN ACTION Notice: • MyArray has six elements (variables), the first being MyArray(0) and the last MyArray(5) . All VBA arrays start from 0, unless you specify otherwise (see discussion of Option Base below). • An array element is treated just like a variable. MyArray(2) is a variable and so is MyArray(i-3) (assuming that i-3 has an integer value > = 0 and < = 5). • The use of the concatenation operator & . This operator concatenates (com- bines) its two operands to create a string. If an operand to the concatenation operator is not a string, it is converted to a string, and then the concatenation takes place. If you try and access an array element that is not part of the array, VBA will return an error value, as demonstrated by the following function: 997 Variables and Arrays Function ArrayDemo2(N) Dim MyArray(5) Dim i As Integer For i = 0 To 5 MyArray(i) = i * i Next i ArrayDemo2 = MyArray(N) End Function LBound and UBound LBound and UBound are two internal VBA functions that are very useful when dealing with arrays . These functions return the minimum and maximum value that an array index can have. The following function demonstrates their use on a one-dimensional array: 1 2 3 4 5 67 8AB C 0 0 <-- =ArrayDemo2(A2)1 1 <-- =ArrayDemo2(A3) 2 4 <-- =ArrayDemo2(A4) 3 9 <-- =ArrayDemo2(A5) 4 16 <-- =ArrayDemo2(A6) 5 25 <-- =ArrayDemo2(A7) 6 #VALUE! <-- =ArrayDemo2(A8)ARRAYDEMO2 IN ACTION Function ArrayDemo3(N) Dim MyArray(5) If N = “LB” Then ArrayDemo3 = LBound(MyArray) ElseIf N = “UB” Then ArrayDemo3 = UBound(MyArray) End If End Function 998 Chapter 37 Note that the array MyArray has six elements, the first being MyArray(0) as indicated by LBound , and the last being MyArray(5) as indicated by UBound . When used on a multidimensional array, a second parameter should be sup- plied indicating the dimension in whose bounds we are interested, as the next function demonstrates. 1 23AB C ) 2 A ( 3 o m e D y a r r A = - - < 0 B L ) 3 A ( 3 o m e D y a r r A = - - < 5 B UARRAYDEMO3 IN ACTION Function ArrayDemo4(Dimension, Bound) Dim MyArray(2, 3, 4) If Bound = “LB” Then ArrayDemo4 = LBound(MyArray, Dimension) ElseIf Bound = “UB” Then ArrayDemo4 = UBound(MyArray, Dimension) End If End Function 1 234 5 67AB C D LB 1 0 <-- =ArrayDemo4(B2,A2) UB 1 2 <-- =ArrayDemo4(B3,A3) LB 2 0 <-- =ArrayDemo4(B4,A4) UB 2 3 <-- =ArrayDemo4(B5,A5) LB 3 0 <-- =ArrayDemo4(B6,A6) UB 3 4 <-- =ArrayDemo4(B7,A7)ARRAYDEMO4 IN ACTION 999 Variables and Arrays How to Get the Bound of an Excel Range in a Function Sadly the internal functions UBound and LBound do not work for a range passed to a function. We can make use of the fact that the parameter is actually a range and use some of its properties to get the result we need. The following function demonstrates this: Function RangeBound(R, What) If What = “C” Then RangeBound = R.Columns.Count ElseIf What = “R” Then RangeBound = R.Rows.Count End If End Function Did you notice that the function does not work with lowercase characters? If we want to be case agnostic, as one usually does, we can use the VBA func-tion UCase to convert “what” to uppercase. 1 2345AB C C 2 <-- =rangebound(D1:E5,A2) R 5 <-- =rangebound(D2:E6,A3) c 0 <-- =rangebound(D3:E7,A4) r 0 <-- =rangebound(D4:E8,A5)RANGEBOUND IN ACTION Function RangeBound1(R, What) If UCase(What) = “C” Then RangeBound1 = R.Columns.Count ElseIf UCase(What) = “R” Then RangeBound1 = R.Rows.Count End If End Function 1000 Chapter 37 Fixing Excel ’ s NPV Function Recall from Chapter 1 that Excel ’ s language about discounted cash flows differs somewhat from the standard finance nomenclature. Excel uses the letters NPV to denote the present value ( not the net present value) of a series of cash flows. To calculate the finance net present value of a series of cash flows using Excel, we have to calculate the present value of the future cash flows (using the Excel NPV func-tion) and subtract from this present value the time-zero cash flow. (This is often the cost of the asset.) Let us try and write a function nNPV that addresses this shortcoming. In the process we shall learn a few things about Excel Ranges in VBA. In order to make the function simple, it will only work on a row of cash flows. 1 2 3 4 5 6AB C C 2 <-- =rangebound1(D1:E5,A2) R 5 <-- =rangebound1(D2:E6,A3) c 2 <-- =rangebound1(D3:E7,A4) r 5 <-- =rangebound1(D4:E8,A5) 1 0 <-- =rangebound1(D5:E9,A6)RANGEBOUND1 IN ACTION Function nNPV(Rate, R) nNPV = R(1) + Application.WorksheetFunction _ .npv(Rate, R.Range(“B1”, R.End(xlToRight))) End Function R.Range(CellTopLeft,CellBottomRight) returns a range defined by its parameters. Note that the cell addresses are relative to R and not the worksheet. R.End(Direction) returns one of the four possible last cells in the R accord- ing to Direction . Possible values for Direction are xlDown, xlToLeft, xlToRight, xlUp. 1001 Variables and Arrays Assuming R is a row of cells, R.Range(“B1”, R.End(xlToRight)) returns a range containing all the cells in R excluding the first one. 1 2 3 4 5 6AB C D E F Cash Flows ▶ -400 100 100 100 100 Rate ▶ 10% Excel NPV ▶ -75.4667776 <-- =NPV($B$3,$B$2:$F$2) Excel C0+NPV ▶-83.01345537 <-- =$B$2+NPV($B$3,$C$2:$F$2) nNPV ▶-83.01345537 <-- =nNPV($B$3,$B$2:$F$2)NNPV IN ACTION A New IRR Function Another useful function we can write using our newly acquired tools is nIRR . Recall from Chapter 1 that the internal rate of return (IRR) is defined as the compound rate of return r that makes the NPV equal to zero: CFCF rt t tN 0 010 + +()= =∑ We now use a technique called successive refinement to calculate IRR: 1. If we were given an initial guess for r we use it and if not we use 50% to calculate NPV . 2. If the calculated NPV is zero (or sufficiently near) we return the current guess. 3. If the calculated NPV is negative we set our guess to r = r + r /2. 4. If the calculated NPV is positive we set our guess to r = r − r /2. 5. We shall now recalculate NPV . 6. Repeat steps 2–5. We assume that the first cash flow is negative and that all others are positive. 1002 Chapter 37 Here is the function: Function nIRR(R, Optional guess = 0.5) n = nNPV(guess, R) Do While Abs(npv) > 0.0001 If n < 0 Then guess = guess - guess / 2 Else guess = guess + guess / 2 End If n = nNPV(guess, R) Loop nIRR = guess End Function Optional Parameters Note that the use of Optional guess = 0.5 to declare the last parameter as optional and give it a default value if the user did not supply one. Once a parameter is declared as optional, all the following parameters have to be declared optional as well. For example, this declaration is fine: Function WillWork(a, Optional b = 5, Optional c = 4) 1003 Variables and Arrays Whereas this will result in an error: As noted, this function is very slow so it might take a few seconds to calculate its results. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9AB C D E F Cash Flows ▶ -375 100 100 100 100 Guess ▶ 5% IRR ▶ 2.63247% <-- =IRR($B$2:$F$2,$B$3) nIRR ▶ 2.63247% <-- =nIRR($B$2:$F$2,$B$3) nIRR ▶ 2.63248% <-- =nIRR($B$2:$F$2) nNPV ▶7.708E-11 <-- =nNPV($B$4,$B$2:$F$2) nNPV ▶9.795E-06 <-- =nNPV($B$5,$B$2:$F$2) nNPV ▶ -9.55E-05 <-- =nNPV($B$6,$B$2:$F$2)NIRR IN ACTION 1004 Chapter 37 The Option Base Statement Excel arrays start at 1, whereas VBA arrays start at 0, unless otherwise defined. We can use a module option to make all not specifically declared array indices start at 1. We use ArrayDemo3 to demonstrate. We open a new VBA module with first line “OptionBase1.” We rename our previous function to reflect this change. Option Base 1 Function ArrayDemo3OptionBase1(N) Dim MyArray(5) If N = “LB” Then ArrayDemo3OptionBase1 = LBound(MyArray) ElseIf N = “UB” Then ArrayDemo3OptionBase1 = UBound(MyArray) End If End Function If we insert Option Base 1 as the first line of the module to get (the only change is in cell B2 where we get 1 and not 0). 1 23AB C LB 1 <-- =ArrayDemo3Optionbase1(A2) UB 5 <-- =ArrayDemo3Optionbase1(A3)ARRAYDEMO3OPTIONBASE1 IN ACTION The Option Base 1 statement, like all option statements, should be inserted before all functions and subroutines in a module. Like all option statements, its effect is limited to all routines in the current module. 1005 Variables and Arrays 37.5 Multidimensional Arrays Arrays can have more than one index. In a two-dimensional array the first index refers to the rows and the second to the columns. There is no formal limit to the number of indices you can declare in an array. The syntax for declaring a multidimensional array is demonstrated in the following functions: Function Matrix1(R, C) Dim MyMat(2, 1) For i = 0 To 2 For j = 0 To 1 MyMat(i, j) = i * j Next j Next i If R > = 0 And R < = 2 And C > = 0 And C < = 1 _ Then Matrix1 = MyMat(R, C) End If End Function 1 23456789 10AB C D R C Matrix1(R,C) 0 0 0 <-- =Matrix1(A3,B3) 1 0 0 <-- =Matrix1(A4,B4)2 0 0 <-- =Matrix1(A5,B5)0 1 0 <-- =Matrix1(A6,B6)1 1 1 <-- =Matrix1(A7,B7)2 1 2 <-- =Matrix1(A8,B8)3 1 0 <-- =Matrix1(A9,B9)1 3 0 <-- =Matrix1(A10,B10)MATRIX1 IN ACTION 1006 Chapter 37 Note the use of the second argument to LBound and UBound . If used with only one argument, both functions return the largest index value the first dimension of the array can have; if the array has more than one dimension (as in this case), we can use a second argument to the function to specify the dimension we are interested in. Function Matrix2(R, C) Dim MyMat(1, 1) For i = LBound(MyMat, 1) To UBound(MyMat, 1) For j = LBound(MyMat, 2) To _ UBound(MyMat, 2) MyMat(i, j) = i * j Next j Next i If R > = LBound(MyMat, 1) And _ R < = UBound(MyMat, 1) And _ C > = LBound(MyMat, 2) And _ C < = UBound(MyMat, 2) Then Matrix2 = MyMat(R, C) End If End Function 1 2 3 4 5 67 8AB C D R C Matrix2(R,C) 0 0 0 <-- =Matrix2(A3,B3) 1 0 0 <-- =Matrix2(A4,B4) 2 0 0 <-- =Matrix2(A5,B5) 0 1 0 <-- =Matrix2(A6,B6) 1 1 1 <-- =Matrix2(A7,B7) 1 2 0 <-- =Matrix2(A8,B8)MATRIX2 IN ACTION The following function demonstrates the use of LBound and UBound with multidimensional arrays: 1007 Variables and Arrays 37.6 Dynamic Arrays and the ReDim Statement Every so often it can be handy to have the size of an array set (and reset) when the program is running. Dynamic arrays are arrays that can have their size changed at run time. You declare dynamic arrays using the Dim statement but with nothing in the parentheses, as in: Dim SomeName() Before you can use the array you need to set its size using the ReDim state- ment, as in: ReDim ArrayName(SomeIntegerExpression) For example, you might type ReDim Prices(12) To set the size of the dynamic array Prices to 12 elements, a more typical case would involve the use of a variable for the size as in: ReDim Prices(I) This will set the size of Prices to the value of I. The ReDim statement can also be used to change the size of a dynamic array (or indeed any VBA array). If you change the size of an array, all the data in the array are lost. Use ReDim Preserve to keep the old data, as in: 1008 Chapter 37 The following function calculates the present value of a series of future cash flows. To simplify the function, the interest rate is fixed at 5% per period. The function illustrates the use of a dynamic array (the variable CF) that derives its size from the size of the original input (the variable n ): ReDim Preserve ArrayName(SomeIntegerExpression) Function DynPV(r As Range) ‘ n is number of periods ‘ cf() is dynamic array for cash ‘ ﬂ ows Dim n Dim cf() Dim Temp Dim i ‘Below we distinguish if the data ‘is in a column or in a row If r.Columns.Count = 1 Then n = r.Rows.Count ElseIf r.Rows.Count = 1 Then n = r.Columns.Count Else Exit Function End If ‘ re-dimension the array ReDim cf(1 To n) For i = 1 To n cf(i) = r(i) Next i Temp = 0 For i = 1 To n Temp = Temp + cf(i) / 1.05 ∧ i Next i DynPV = Temp End Function 1009 Variables and Arrays Running the function produces the following: Using the ReDim Preserve Statement As stated previously the Preserve part of the ReDim statement prevents the loss of data from the re-dimensioned array. The use of Preserve imposes two major limitations on the use of ReDim . • The inability to change the lower boundary of the index. • The inability to change the number of dimensions. The main use of the ReDim Preserve is in interactive programs and as such it will be demonstrated in a later chapter dealing with user interaction. 37.7 Array Assignment Here ’ s an error that ’ s easy to make: In the following example we want to tell VBA that Array2 is equal to Array1 : 1 2 3 4 5 6AB C Cash Flows 100200 300 DynPV ▶ 535.79527 <-- =DynPV(A3:A5)DYNPV IN VERTICAL ACTION 1 23AB C D Cash Flows ▶ 100 200 300 DynPV ▶ 535.79527 <-- =DynPV(B2:D2)DYNPV IN HORIZONTAL ACTION 1010 Chapter 37 VBA doesn ’ t allow this, as you can see on the next screen shot. Function ArrayAssignError() Dim Array1(5) Dim Array2(5) For i = 0 To 4 Array1(i) = i * i Next i Array2 = Array1 ArrayAssignError = Array2 End Function Obviously one way to assign arrays is to assign each element separately using a For loop. For I = 0 To 4: Array2(I) = Array1(I): Next I 1011 Variables and Arrays The : Operator Note the use of the “ : ” operator to signal the end of a statement. This way we can put two or more short statements on the same line. Another, much shorter, way of assigning arrays is discussed in the next section. 37.8 Variants Containing an Array A Variant type variable can contain an array. The procedure is somewhat more complicated than the declaration of a normal array, but the reward in terms of assignment is sometimes worth the inconvenience. The following function demonstrates the use of a Variant containing an array: 01 Function ArrayAssign(r, j) 02 Dim Array1 ‘This is a variant 03 Dim Array2 ‘This is a variant 04 Dim n ‘number of elements ‘in R 05 Array1 = Array() 06 If r.Columns.Count = 1 Then ‘data in column 07 n = r.Rows.Count 08 ElseIf r.Rows.Count = 1 Then ‘data in row 09 n = r.Columns.Count 10 Else ‘invalid data 11 Exit Function 12 End If 13 ReDim Array1(1 To n) 14 For i = 1 To n 15 Array1(i) = r(i) 16 Next i 17 ‘****************************Watch this spot 18 Array2 = Array1 ‘Watch this spot 19 ‘****************************Watch this spot 20 If j > = 1 And j < = n Then 21 ArrayAssign = Array2(j) 22 End If 23 End Function 1012 Chapter 37 Function ComputePV(CF()) Temp = 0 For i = LBound(CF) To UBound(CF) Temp = Temp + CF(i) / 1.05 ∧ i Next i ComputePV = Temp End Function The Array() function (on the fifth line) returns a Variant containing an array. The assignment on the same line makes Array1 into an array (not ini- tialized at the moment). The ReDim statement on line 15 makes Array1 into an n element array. The reward for all our trouble is illustrated on line 18. Here is the function in a worksheet context: 1 2 3 4 5 67 8AB C D E 55 88 77 12 99 1 55 <-- =ArrayAssign($A$2:$E$2,A3) 2 88 <-- =ArrayAssign($A$2:$E$2,A4) 3 77 <-- =ArrayAssign($A$2:$E$2,A5) 4 12 <-- =ArrayAssign($A$2:$E$2,A6) 5 99 <-- =ArrayAssign($A$2:$E$2,A7) 6 0 <-- =ArrayAssign($A$2:$E$2,A8)ARRAYASSIGN IN HORIZONTAL ACTION 37.9 Arrays as Parameters to Functions Arrays can be used as parameters to functions. The following set of functions presents an improved version of DynPV discussed in section 37.6. Notice how much easier it is to read the main function NewDynPV , when all the auxiliary tasks are relegated to separate functions. A function ComputePV(CF()) is used to compute the present value of a series of cash flows contained in an array of Doubles . 1013 Variables and Arrays Note the fact that in ComputePV(CF()) , CF() has to be declared without index information. Consequently, we use LBound and UBound to get index information. The function GetN(R As Range) returns the number of elements in R: Function GetN(R As Range) If R.Columns.Count = 1 Then ‘data in column GetN = R.Rows.Count ElseIf R.Rows.Count = 1 Then ‘data in row GetN = R.Columns.Count Else GetN = 0 End If End Function Here is the main function: Function NewDynPV(R As Range) Dim n As Integer ‘ Number of periods Dim CF() As Double ‘ Dynamic array for cash ﬂ ows n = GetN(R) If (n = 0) Then NewDynPV = n Exit Function End If ReDim CF(1 To n) ‘ re-dimension the array For i = 1 To n CF(i) = R(i) Next i NewDynPV = ComputePV(CF) End Function 1014 Chapter 37 1 23AB C D Cash Flows ▶ 100 200 300 NewDynPV ▶535.79527 <-- =newDynPV(B2:D2)NEWDYNPV IN ACTION Better IRR and NPV Functions We can now revisit nIRR and nNPV from section 37.4, and try and make them faster using internal arrays. Function fNPV(Rate, cf) Temp = 0 For i = LBound(cf, 2) + 1 To UBound(cf, 2) Temp = Temp + cf(1, i) / (1 + Rate) ∧ _ (i - 1) Next i fNPV = Temp + cf(1, LBound(cf, 2)) End Function Function fIRR(R, Optional guess = 0.5) cf = R.Value n = fNPV(guess, cf) Do While Abs(npv) > 0.0001 If n < 0 Then guess = guess - guess / 2 Else guess = guess + guess / 2 End If n = fNPV(guess, cf) Loop fIRR = guess End Function 1015 Variables and Arrays This works an order of magnitude faster but can be further improved. 37.10 Using Types All values, variables, and functions in VBA are categorized into types, either by default or explicitly. By default all variables and functions in VBA are of the type Variant . Variant is a category of values (type) that includes all other categories. In most cases we can just ignore the type, but sometimes it can be very useful to give a variable a type other than Variant . Variable types allow VBA to give us information about the variable as we use it, and this will become apparent as we start using Excel objects in the following chapters. For now we will just explain the mechanics of defining a typed variable, and provide a short demonstration of the help offered by VBA when dealing with typed variables. A type is given to a variable when it is defined by following the variables name with the word As followed with a type name. For example, the statement “Dim x As Integer” defines a variable named x of the type Integer. To demonstrate the usefulness of typed variables recall the function RangeBound from section 37.4. Here is a new version with the first parameter explicitly given the type Range. Although not necessary (it worked without it), it does make life easier. When you type in the function and a variable has a type, VBA can give you hints as you try to use properties. In our example, as soon as you type the period after R, VBA provides a list of possible Proper-ties or Methods. If the selected property (Rows, in our case) has properties of its own, then a period following its name will produce a list for you to choose from. 1 2 3 45 6 7 8 9AB C D E F Cash Flows ▶ -375 100 100 100 100 Guess ▶ 5% IRR ▶ 2.63247% <-- =IRR($B$2:$F$2,$B$3) fIRR ▶ 2.63247% <-- =fIRR($B$2:$F$2,$B$3) fIRR ▶ 2.63248% <-- =fIRR($B$2:$F$2) nNPV ▶ 7.70797E-11 <-- =nNPV($B$4,$B$2:$F$2) nNPV ▶ 9.79546E-06 <-- =nNPV($B$5,$B$2:$F$2) nNPV ▶ -9.54928E-05 <-- =nNPV($B$6,$B$2:$F$2)FIRR IN ACTION 1016 Chapter 37 37.11 Summary VBA functions use variables to store information. Variables can hold all sorts of information. Declaring and using variables that can hold only a specific type of information ( Typed Variables ) can make your programming task easier and your programs more readable, and use less computer memory. 1017 Variables and Arrays An array is a group of variables of the same type, sharing the same name and referenced individually using one or more indices. In VBA an array index is an integer. By default the index of the first element in an array is 0; this can be changed to 1 for all arrays used in a module by using the Option Base 1 statement. The size and number of dimensions of an array are set at the time the array is declared and have to be known when the program is written. Dynamic arrays are arrays whose size (but not number of dimensions) can be set at run time. Exercises 1.

Subroutines are sometimes called macros. Modules and module variables are introduced as the last subject of this chapter. 38.2 Subroutines A subroutine looks like a function, but the word “Sub” replaces the word Function in the definition. The parentheses following the subroutine name are blank (recall that the parentheses following the function name give the func-tion ’ s parameters). Separating the first and last line are the statements that the subroutine executes. The following is a very simple subroutine that puts a message on the screen: Sub SayHi() MsgBox “Hi”, , “I say Hi” End Sub The above subroutine introduces a built-in VBA subroutine called MsgBox . It also introduces the way one subroutine is activated (called) from another. MsgBox is named as a command on a line followed by its list of arguments separated by commas. Notice the syntax: MsgBox “Hi”, , “I say Hi” The commas separate the three arguments of every MsgBox : • “Hi” is the message which will be displayed. • The second argument is empty: Notice the space between the commas. This argument can be used to define buttons for the message box. This topic is discussed in section 38.3. • The third argument is “I say Hi”—this is the message box title. 1024 Chapter 38 A subroutine can be activated (run) from an Excel worksheet in various ways. The simplest way of running a subroutine is from the Macros button on the Developer tab on the Ribbon or by using the keyboard shortcut [Alt] + F8. Either way, the macro selection box appears. 1 The box lists all available subroutines alphabetically. Find our subroutine, click on its name, and click the Run button. And this is what you will see: 1. If you don ’ t have the Developer tab, go to File|Options|Customize the Ribbon . In the right side of the resulting screen, mark the Developer box. 1025 Subroutines and User Interaction At this point Excel is locked up—you have to click the OK button before you can proceed. Keyboard Shortcut for Subroutines Using a keyboard shortcut is a faster way to make a subroutine run. To attach a shortcut to our subroutine: • Select the Options button from the macro selection box. • Type a character in the provided space and click OK . • Close the macro selection box using the corner X . You can now activate the subroutine using the shortcut ([Ctrl] + h, in our case). 1026 Chapter 38 Recording a Subroutine One easy way to start writing subroutines is to record the sequence of actions you want in the subroutine, and then edit the resulting subroutine to produce the final results you need. Something we do a lot in this book is to insert the function Getformula in a cell to the right of the cell with the interesting formula. Let ’ s record a subroutine that performs this action (see Figures 38.1–38.3 ). 1. Select the cell to the right of the cell with the formula we are interested in (B4, in our case) 2. Select the Developer tab on the ribbon. 3. In the code group click Use Relative References . This causes Excel to record relative cell addresses in the subroutine rather than its default, which is to record the actual cell addresses. 4. Click Record Macro . 5. At this point you have the option to name the subroutine as well as all sorts of other options. Since we are going to change most of these options in the near future, we ignore all options and finally click OK to start recording. 6. Type in the formula = Getformula(A4) . 7. Click Stop Recording (this is the same button that used to be the Record Macro button). 1027 Subroutines and User Interaction Figure 38.1 Indicating recording with relative references. Figure 38.2 Start recording the subroutine. Figure 38.3 End subroutine recording. Button is in the same place as the Record Macro button. RECORDING A SUBROUTINE—SCREENS 1028 Chapter 38 Running a Subroutine from a Button on the Worksheet Instead of running the subroutine from the Developer tab or running it from a key combination, we can also insert a button on the worksheet to run a subroutine on that worksheet. To illustrate, we insert a button that runs the subroutine RecordGetformula : 1. Select the Developer tab on the ribbon. 2. In the Controls group, click Insert . 3. From the Form Controls, select Button . Sub RecordGetformula() ‘ Puts in Getformula, points to cell ‘ to the left If IsEmpty(ActiveCell) Then ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = _ “ = getformula(RC[-1])” End If End Sub If we now go to the VBA editor we can see that a new module has been added to the workbook. The module contains Macro1 : Sub Macro1() ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = _ “ = getformula(RC[-1])” End Sub We can add some bells and whistles to this recorded subroutine. In the recorded subroutine below, we changed the name and put in a line to prevent the accidental overwriting of a non-blank cell. 1029 Subroutines and User Interaction 4. Drag the crosshair on the sheet to draw the button. 5. Once you release the mouse button, the Assign Macro dialogue will appear. 6. Select our subroutine and click OK . 1030 Chapter 38 38.3 User Interaction In this section we show how to use subroutines to elicit data from the user of the spreadsheet. We illustrate with the MsgBox command, which (as discussed above) displays a message on the screen and returns a value based on the button clicked. Some of the different options available with this function are demonstrated in the following subroutines: Sub MsgBoxDefault() Dim Temp As Integer Temp = MsgBox(“Default Message”, , _ “Default Title”) MsgBox _ “The value returned by MsgBox is: “ _ & Temp End Sub 7. The button should be selected (control handles all round) and you can now edit the text that appears on the button. If the button is not selected, right-clicking on it will open a local menu enabling you to change the text or the subroutine assigned to the button. 1031 Subroutines and User Interaction Note: The default configuration of MsgBox produces one OK button. The default title is “Microsoft Excel.” Clicking the OK button makes MsgBox return the value 1. Sub MsgBoxOKCancel() Dim Temp As Integer Temp = MsgBox(“Default Message”, _ vbOKCancel) MsgBox _ “The value returned by MsgBox is: “ _ & Temp End Sub As previously noted, the second argument to MsgBox determines which buttons are displayed. This incarnation of the demo subroutine uses the con-stant vbOKCancel to produce the two buttons OK and Cancel . Note that if the Cancel button is clicked, MsgBox returns the value 2. 1032 Chapter 38 Sub PVCalculator() Dim CF CF = InputBox(“Enter the cash ﬂ ow value”, _ “PV calculator”, “100”) MsgBox “The present value of 4” & CF & _ “At 5% for 10 periods is: “ & _ Round(Application.PV(0.05, 10, -CF), _ 2), vbInformation, “PV calculator” End Sub CF = InputBox(“Enter the cash ﬂ ow value”, _ “PV calculator”, “100”) Note the syntax: • “Enter … please,” the first argument in InputBox , is the message to display. • “PV calculator,” the second argument, is the title for the box. • “100,” the third argument, is the default string to place in the box. If you do not replace this by some other value, this will also be the returned value from the function. • Running the subroutine should result in the following: InputBox: Getting Data from the User InputBox is an internal VBA function used to get textual information from the user into a variable in a subroutine. The workings of the function are demonstrated in the following present value calculator subroutine. The subroutine PVCalculator calculates CF t t 10 5 110 .()=∑ , where CF is a number input- ted by the user: 1033 Subroutines and User Interaction At this point you can replace “100” by some other number (in this example, we ’ ve chosen to leave it). Clicking on the OK button results in the following box: 38.4 Using Subroutines to Change the Excel Workbook Subroutines can be used to make changes to a spreadsheet. Here ’ s a small example, very similar to the example presented at the end of Chapter 35. In this version of the subroutine we change the current region ’ s format to numbers with comma separators and without decimals. 1034 Chapter 38 ActiveCell.CurrentRegion is the range around the active cell (B5 in the screen snaps), the same range that would be selected by pressing [Ctrl] + A in the worksheet (A3:C7 in the screen shots). After: Sub Format() ActiveCell.CurrentRegion.NumberFormat _ = “#,##0” End Sub 1035 Subroutines and User Interaction Sub ConvertToThousands() s = ActiveCell.CurrentRegion.Cells.Count For i = 1 To s ActiveCell.CurrentRegion(i).Value = _ Round(ActiveCell.CurrentRegion(i). _ Value / 1000, 0) Next i End Sub After: The next subroutine changes the actual data in ActiveCell.CurrentRegion to thousands by dividing each number in the range by 1,000 and rounding it to the nearest integer. 1036 Chapter 38 38.5 Modules VBA organizes user-defined functions and subroutines in units called modules. We can (and sometimes should) have more than one module in a VBA project (i.e., the part of the workbook that has our functions and subroutines). Modules have names: By default VBA uses the name “Module” followed by a number to indicate the module ’ s name, but you might find it useful to give them a somewhat more descriptive name. To rename a module (in the VBA Editor), select the module on the Project Explorer pane: 1037 Subroutines and User Interaction If the Project Explorer pane is not visible, select Project Explorer from the View menu. Once a module is selected, the module ’ s list of properties should appear in the Properties Pane . If the Properties Pane is not visible, select Properties Window from the View menu. Click on the module ’ s name (it should be the only property available) and change it. A module name should start with an alphabetic character and consist of only alphabetic characters, digits, and the underscore character (_); no other characters should be used. Once you tap the Enter key, the name is changed. Notice the change in the Project Explorer. 1038 Chapter 38 Modules must have unique names, and they cannot be named after subrou- tines and functions. If a module called Tom has a function called Tom in it, the function Tom will not be available to the workbook. One common practice is to start module names (and only module names) with M. Module Variables The Dim statement can be used before any routine in the module to define a module variable. Module variables are recognized anywhere in the module and keep their value until the workbook is closed. Module variables can be used to store information relevant to more than one routine without the need to pass the information via the parameters. Module variables are more commonly used in large modules with many interacting routines, so the following demonstra-tion is, of necessity, somewhat trivial: Dim MyStatus Sub SetMyStatus() MyStatus = InputBox _ (“Enter value for my status”, , “OK”) Calculate End Sub Function MyStatusIs() MyStatusIs = MyStatus End Function Sub ShowMyStatus() MsgBox “MyStatus is: “ & MyStatus End Sub Function MyStatusIsVolatile() Application.Volatile MyStatusIsVolatile = MyStatus End Function 1039 Subroutines and User Interaction When you first open the workbook, here is what you see: If you click on you get the Input Box : And a click on the OK button will produce the following: We now know that the variable MyStatus has the value “OK.” So why is the function MyStatusIs returning a zero, or for that matter, why is MyStatusIsVolatile returning the (correct) value of “OK”? 1040 Chapter 38 Application.Volatile The answer to the question above lies with the Application.Volatile statement in MyStatusIsVolatile . When Application.Volatile is used as the first state- ment in a function used in a worksheet, the function gets recalculated when- ever something gets recalculated on the worksheet. MyStatusIs will only recalculate if its (nonexisting) parameter changes, in this case only if we edit the cell and press Enter. So if we if we select cell A3, press F2 (for Edit Cell), and press Enter we get OK <-- =MyStatusIs() OK <-- =MyStatusIsVolatile()MODULE VARIABLES IN ACTION Set MyStatus Show MyStatus 38.6 Summary A subroutine is a VBA user routine used to automate routine or repetitive operations in Excel. VBA provides two important and very flexible functions for user interaction: MsgBox and InputBox . VBA groups subroutines and functions into units called modules; keeping related functions and subroutines grouped is useful when dealing with large projects. All of these topics, explored in this chapter, will help you with financial programming in Excel. Exercises 1. Write a subroutine that displays the following message box. The message box should be on top of all other windows, and prevent the user from doing anything in any application, until one of the buttons is clicked. Hint: You need to use some options of MsgBox that were not covered in the text, use the VBA help system. 1041 Subroutines and User Interaction 2. Write a present value calculator subroutine similar to the one which appears in section 38.4. However—as illustrated below—your subroutine should ask the user for the cash flow value, the interest rate, and the number of periods. It should then display the result in a message box. Sensible default values should be supplied for all arguments. Do not use the Excel function PV ; write your own present value function and use it. A reminder: PVC F rnCF ri in (, , )()=+=∑11 You can use the PV function provided by Excel, as we did, to verify the correctness of your subroutine. 1042 Chapter 38 3. Rewrite the subroutine in the previous exercise so that the user interface is as demonstrated in the following screen shots. Some of the functions needed to write the subroutine were not covered in the text. We used the following functions: • Val —A function used to convert a string of digits to a number. • Left —A function used to return the left part of a string. • Right —A function used to return the right part of a string. • FormatPercent —A function used to format a number. • FormatCurrency —A function used to format a number. More information about these functions is available from the VBA Help file. We recom- mend you use it. Not e: Your computer might display a different currency symbol. 4. Rewrite the subroutine in the previous exercise so it deals properly with the Cancel button. • A simple version of the new subroutine will abort the subroutine if Cancel is clicked in any stage. • A more sophisticated version of the new subroutine will allow the user to reenter the data from scratch. • The most sophisticated version of the new subroutine will allow reentering the data using the old data as a default. Note: The last version is a slightly more complicated exercise using loops within loops. 1043 Subroutines and User Interaction 5. Write a payment schedule calculator subroutine. The subroutine is to ask the user for the sum of the loan, the number of payments, and the interest rate. Assume payment at the end of the period. The output should look like the example below. Hints: • You may want to use the worksheet function PMT . • The following subroutine and its output might be of interest: Here is an example of the requested subroutine in action: 1044 Chapter 38 6. Rewrite the payment schedule calculator subroutine so it displays the payments broken down into interest and capital payments. The input boxes in the example were removed for compactness. 7. Write a payment schedule calculator subroutine. The subroutine is to ask the user for the sum of the loan, the payment, and the interest rate. Assume payment at the end of the period. The subroutine should display the payments broken down into interest and capital payments. Obviously, the last payment can be smaller (but not larger) than the payment supplied by the user. The output should look like the example below (input boxes removed for compactness): 1045 Subroutines and User Interaction 8. A somewhat more complicated version of the subroutine in exercise 7 would produce the following, better-looking results. Write this version of the subroutine. Note : A quick look at the Help file for the Format function might be advantageous at this point. 9. A sliding payment schedule involves payment that changes by a fixed percentage over the life of the loan. Write a sliding payment version of the payment schedule calculator in exercise 8. In addition to all the inputs described above, the subroutine will get a payment rate of change (as percentage) from the user. This is what it should look like in action: 3 9 Objects and Add-Ins 39.1 Overview This chapter deals with several more advanced subjects in VBA. Most of these subjects relate to the Excel Object Model. The bulk of the chapter describes some useful Excel objects and ways of dealing with them. Names, a way to make worksheets clearer and more readable, are presented in section 39.6. The chapter closes with a discussion of Excel Add-Ins, one easy way to make self-crafted functions automatically available across workbooks. 39.2 Introduction to Worksheet Objects Objects are the basic building blocks of VBA. Although you may not be aware that you are using objects, most things you do in VBA require the manipulation of objects. We can think of an object as a sort of a container with variables, functions, and subroutines inside. All of Excel ’ s components (workbooks, worksheets, ranges, etc.) are represented by an object in the VBA Object Hierarchy. The object ’ s data are held in special variables called properties that can be accessed using the Dot (.) operator. One of the most important object types in VBA is the Range Object . A worksheet cell and a range of cells are all objects of the type Range . The following subsection introduces some pre- defined Range Object variables. The Active Cell VBA has many variables predefined for our use; one of the more useful is ActiveCell . ActiveCell is a predefined Range Object variable that represents the cell in the worksheet with the cursor box around it. The follow-ing function replaces the contents of the active cell with a string representation of the contents. We use the property Formula ; this property holds the text in the cell as a string and can be changed. Sub ToString() ActiveCell.Formula = “’” & _ ActiveCell.Formula End Sub 1048 Chapter 39 The Selection Another very useful predefined variable is the Selection . This variable represents the currently selected item in Excel. Unlike the ActiveCell variable, Selection is not limited to a range and can be any selection (range, chart, and many more). We suggest that you check the type using the TypeName function. Methods are functions contained within an object. Methods are used to manipulate the object. Like properties, methods can be accessed using the Dot (.) operator. The line between methods and properties is sometimes very fuzzy. The following subroutine demonstrates some methods of the Range Object , and use of the predefined variable Selection : Before After Sub SelectBlank() If UCase(TypeName(Selection)) < > “RANGE” _ Then Exit Sub Selection.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeBlanks). _ Select End Sub The first line checks to see if the current selection is a range and stops the subroutine if it is not; a message would have been appropriate under non-educational circumstances. 1049 Objects and Add-Ins The first part of the second line Selection.SpecialCells (xlCellTypeBlanks) uses the SpecialCells method of the Range Object to return a Range containing all the blank cells in the current selection. The Select method of the returned Range is activated to select it. Before After 39.3 The Range Object In the previous section we encountered some predefined Range Object vari- ables. This section demonstrates the use of ranges in VBA and presents more of the properties and methods of the Range Object . A Range as a Parameter to a Function In this subsection we build a function that accepts a Range as a parameter. Our new function, named MeanReturn , accepts a column range of asset prices as a parameter and computes and returns the mean return of the assets in the column. Recall that the return of an asset for period t i s rPrice Price Pricettt t=− − −1 1 and the mean return of an asset is rNrt tN = =∑1 1 . An auxiliary function AssetReturn is used to compute r t . 1050 Chapter 39 Function MeanReturn(Rng) NumRows = Rng.Rows.Count Prices = Rng.Value T = 0 For i = 2 To NumRows T = T + AssetReturn(Prices(i - 1, 1), _ Prices(i, 1)) Next i MeanReturn = T / (NumRows - 1) End Function Lines of note: • NumRows = Rng.Rows.Count In this line the Dot operator is used twice. Rng is our Range object. Rows is property of the Range object so Rng.Rows is an object of the Collection type that represents all the rows in our range. Count is a property of Collection type objects that stores the number of members in the collection, so Rng.Rows.Count is a variable that stores the number of rows in our range. • Prices = Rng.Value Value is a property of the Range object containing the values of all the cells in the range. Value is of the type Variant . If the range is more than one cell in size Value is a two-dimensional array. The first index of Value is the row index starting from 1, and the second index is the column index staring from 1. 1051 Objects and Add-Ins The Range Property The Range property is one way to access a range on a worksheet. Range is a property of many Excel objects. When used on its own, as in the next sub- routine, Range is a short way of writing ActiveSheet.Range . 1 2345678AB C 100 110 10.00% <-- =(A3-A2)/A2121 10.00% <-- =(A4-A3)/A3145 19.83% <-- =(A5-A4)/A4174 20.00% <-- =(A6-A5)/A5 14.96% <-- =AVERAGE(B3:B6)14.96% <-- =MeanReturn(A2:A6)MEANRETURN IN ACTION Sub RangeDemo() Range(“A2”).Formula = 23 End Sub As expected, the subroutine will set the formula in cell A2 of the active worksheet to 23. Before After 1052 Chapter 39 The next subroutine sets the formula of each cell in the range A2:C3 of the active worksheet to 23. Sub RangeDemo1() Range(“A2:C3”).Formula = 23 End Sub Another way of addressing a range of cells using the Range property is demonstrated by the next subroutine. The subroutine sets the formula of each cell in the range A2:C3 of the active worksheet to 23. The first argument to Range is the cell in the top left corner of the range, and the second is the cell in the bottom right corner of the range. Sub RangeDemo2() Range(“A2”, “C3”).Formula = 23 End Sub Range is also a property of the Range object. The range returned by Range when used this way is relative to the Range object. The next subrou- tine sets the formula of the cell C3 of the active worksheet to 999. Sub RangeDemo3() Range(“B2”).Range(“B2”).Formula = 999 End Sub 1053 Objects and Add-Ins Note: Range(“B2”) returns the range (or cell) B2 of the active worksheet. Range(“B2”).Range(“B2”) returns the cell B2 of the range that has B2 as the top left corner. In worksheet terms, Range(“B2”).Range(“B2”) returns the cell C3. The next subroutine sets the formula of each cell in the range C2:D3 of the active worksheet to 23. The subroutine uses the cell C2 as a starting point. Sub RangeDemo4() Range(“C2”).Range(“A1”, “B2”).Formula = 23 End Sub Note: Range(“C2”) is the same as Range(“C2”).Range(“A1”) and refers to the cell C2 in the worksheet. Range(“C2”).Range(“B2”) refers to the cell D3 in the worksheet, B2 means one column to the left and one line down. And so Range(“C2”).Range(“A1”, “B2”) is the same as Range(“C2”, “D3”) . 39.4 The With Statement The With statement allows you to perform a series of statements on a speci-fied object without restating the obvious (the object ’ s name and its pedigree, which can be very long). If you have more than one property to change or more than one method to use for a single object, use the With statement. With statements make your procedures run faster, and help you avoid repeti-tive typing. The following, somewhat contrived, subroutine sets some proper-ties of the font of the cell in the top left-hand corner of the current region of the active cell. The font is set to be Arial, bold, and 15 points in size. 1054 Chapter 39 And here is the same subroutine using the With statement: Sub WithoutDemo() ActiveCell.CurrentRegion.Range(“A1”). _ Font.Bold = True ActiveCell.CurrentRegion.Range(“A1”). _ Font.Name = “Arial” ActiveCell.CurrentRegion.Range(“A1”). _ Font.size = 15 End Sub Sub WithDemo() With ActiveCell.CurrentRegion. _ Range(“A1”).Font .Bold = True .Name = “Arial” .size = 15 End With End Sub Notice the Dot (.) operator before the properties in the With statement. Recall from Chapter 38 that ActiveCell.CurrentRegion is the con- tiguous range of non-empty cells around the active cell (C3 in the screen shots), the same range that would be selected by pressing [Ctrl] + A in the worksheet (A1:D4 in the screen shots). Before 1055 Objects and Add-Ins 39.5 Collections A Collection is a set of items that can be referred to as a unit. Members can be added using the Add method and removed using the Remove method. Specific members can be referred to using an integer index. The number of members currently in a Collection is available via the Count method. Our use of Collections will be restricted to using the (quite numerous) arsenal of Collections that are part of the Excel Object Model, to name but a few, Range is a collection of cells, Worksheets is a collection of all the worksheets in a workbook, and Workbooks is a collection of all the open workbooks in Excel. The For Each Statement in Use with Arrays and Collections The For Each statement is a variation of the For loop. This statement comes in two distinct flavors. The first variation uses the statement to loop over a VBA array as demonstrated in the following subroutine: After 1056 Chapter 39 Points of note: 1. The current member of the array is available to the statements within the loop body through the loop variable ( Element in the above function). 2. The loop variable ( Element in the above example) has to be of the type Variant irrespective of the array type. 3. Changes to Element will not be reﬂ ected in the actual array. Notice that the changes to Element in line 8 are not re ﬂ ected in y . 4. You don ’ t need to know the number of dimensions or the range of indices to loop over the array. Sub ForEachDemo() Dim A(4) For i = 0 To 4: A(i) = i * i: Next i x = “x is: “ y = “y is: “ For Each Element In A x = x & vbTab & Element Element = Element * 2 Next Element For Each Element In A y = y & vbTab & Element Next Element MsgBox x & vbCrLf & y, , “For Each Demo” End Sub 1057 Objects and Add-Ins The For Each Statement in Use with Collections The second version of the For Each statement loops over Collections : Sub ZeroRange() Set Rng = ActiveCell.CurrentRegion For Each Cell In Rng Cell.Formula = 0 Next Cell End Sub Here is what happens when you run the subroutine: 1058 Chapter 39 Points of note: 1. Ranges are collections and so the variable Rng is a collection of all the cells in the current region of the active cell (C3:D15 in our example). 2 . Cell is a variable used to iterate over all the members of the collection. 3 . Cell has to be one of the following types: Variant , Object , or the specific type of element the Collection is made of. (Recall that all vari- ables are of type Variant unless specifically defined.) 4 . Cell refers to the actual member of the Collection , and changes to Cell will be reflected in the Collection . 5. A complete explanation of the use of the Set statement is beyond the scope of this book. For our purposes, just prefix the reserved word Set to all object assignments. Before After 1059 Objects and Add-Ins The Workbooks Collection and the Workbook Object All the currently open workbooks are represented by a Workbook object in the Workbooks Collection . The following subroutine lists all open workbooks: Sub ListOpenWorkbooks() Temp = “List of open Workbooks” & _ “ Created on:” & FormatDateTime(Date, _ vbLongDate) _ & “ At: “ & FormatDateTime(Time, _ vbLongTime) For Each Element In Workbooks Temp = Temp & vbCrLf & Element.FullName Next Element MsgBox Temp, vbOKOnly, “List of open _ Workbooks” End Sub 1060 Chapter 39 Lines of note: Temp = “List of open Workbooks” & _ “ Created on:” & _ FormatDateTime(Date, vbLongDate) _ & “ At: “ & _ FormatDateTime(Time, vbLongTime) • The Date function returns the current system date. • The Time function returns the current system time. • The FormatDateTime function formats Date and Time variables for display. For Each Element In Workbooks Temp = Temp & vbCrLf & Element.FullName Next Element The For statement loops over the entire Workbooks Collection . On each iteration, Element is one of the Workbook objects in the Collection . FullName is a property of the Workbook object containing the full path name of the workbook. The Worksheets Collection and the Worksheet Object All the worksheets in a workbook are Worksheet objects in the Worksheets Collection that is a property of the Workbook object. We can use the Worksheets Collection without an object as a short form for ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets . 1061 Objects and Add-Ins 39.6 Names In Excel you can use user-defined names to refer to a cell or a range of cells. Use easy-to-understand names, such as Products, to refer to hard-to-understand ranges, such as Sales!C20:C30 . Using names can make for- mulas easy to read: Compare the formula = sum(‘sheet12’!a10:a10) to = sum(lastYearSales) . This section deals with the VBA side of names. Naming a Range Using a Subroutine The following subroutine gives the name “Jon” to the cells selected. Sub NameSelection() Names.Add “Jon”, “ = ” & _ Selection.Address End Sub Select cells A2:B3 and run the subroutine. The next two screenshots show the Excel name box before and after we operate the NameSelection subroutine: Before 1062 Chapter 39 Names is a Collection of all the names in the active workbook. Add is a method of the Names Collection used to add members to the collec- tion. We use only the first two parameters of the method. The first parameter “Jon” is the name to add to the Names Collection . The second param- eter is a string containing the address, formula, or value to which the added name refers, preceded by = . Looking for Defined Names The name “Jon” has just now been defined, and we can use it in the workbook as demonstrated in the following screen shot. Notice that whatever capitaliza-tion you use, Excel reverts to the original “Jon.” The name “Jon” is not directly available in VBA as demonstrated by the fol-lowing function: After 1063 Objects and Add-Ins Function SumJon() SumJon = Application.WorksheetFunction. _ Sum(Jon) End Function Referring to a Named Range To get to values in a named range we can use the built-in function Application.Evaluate , as demonstrated by the next function. Note that the function is designed to be used as an Array Function and the use of Application.Volatile to make sure the value gets updated whenever a change is made to the workbook. 1 2 3AB C 10 <-- =SUM(Jon) 0 <-- =SumJon()SUM(Jon) IN ACTION Function JonAsArray() Application.Volatile JonAsArray = Application.Evaluate(“Jon”) End Function Referring to the actual range the name refers to is beyond the scope of this book. 1 2 3AB C 1 3 <-- {=JonAsArray()} 2 4 <-- {=JonAsArray()}JonASARRAY IN ACTION 1064 Chapter 39 39.7 Add-Ins and Integration An Excel Add-In is a file that Excel can load when it starts up. The file contains VBA code that adds additional functionality to Excel, usually in the form of new functions. Add-Ins provide an excellent way of increasing the power of Excel and they are the ideal vehicle for distributing your custom functions. This section shows you how to convert an Excel Workbook containing VBA functions to an Add-In, and how to load and use Add-Ins in Excel and VBA. The process is somewhat arcane and the steps below should be followed in the order in which they are presented. Create and Debug Your Base Workbook As editing an Add-In once it ’ s created is very difficult, it is important that the original workbook on which the Add-In is based is kept intact and as a work-book. For this demonstration we have created a workbook containing one worksheet and a VBA project containing one module with one function and one subroutine. 1065 Objects and Add-Ins Convert the Base Workbook to an Add-In To make the Add-In, save the workbook as an Add-In. Select Save As from the Excel file menu and change Save as type to “Excel Add-In (*.xlam).” The Save in location will change to the Add-Ins directory on your computer. You may want to navigate to a different location (we tend to keep files together). Now click Save . You may want to use a new name for the Add-In (we did not). 1066 Chapter 39 Install and Use an Add-In from an Excel Worksheet Installing an Add-In is done on a per computer basis (actually per computer user basis). So we do not get confused with the chapter we suggest you close Excel and reopen it with a brand new Excel workbook. Select Developer | Add-Ins . The following dialogue should be presented (your names may vary): 1067 Objects and Add-Ins Click Browse and navigate to the location of your Add-In. Select it and click OK . Notice that a new Add-In is available and activated. Click OK to close the Add-Ins dialogue. All the functions in our Add-in are now available to all workbooks in Excel. To verify insert a formula in a cell (A1), select the cell next to the cell with the formula (B1), and press [Alt] + F8. You should get the Macro dialogue box. Notice that, sadly, annotate is not on the list, but if you type “annotate” in the Macro name box, then the Run button will become available and when pressed will produce the expected results. 1068 Chapter 39 39.8 Summary This chapter discussed two separate topics. We started with a more extensive discussion of objects, which underlie the VBA programming concept. Objects allow you to be much more parsimonious in expressing your programming references. We finished the chapter with a discussion of how to build Add-Ins in Excel. Exercises 1. Suppose you have a spreadsheet with a series of numbers and formulas: Suppose you want to turn this into: 1069 Objects and Add-Ins Write a subroutine that does this. Your subroutine should: • Put in a set of parentheses and multiply the cell contents by 100. • Move down one cell (see ActiveCellDemo1 , section 39.1). • Ask if you want to repeat the process (if “yes,” it should do it; if “no,” the subroutine should exit). Note: The parentheses have to come after the “ = .” The Right function might be used for this operation. You may want to refer to section 39.2 for more information on the MsgBox function and the values it returns. 2. Rewrite the subroutine in exercise 1 so that it deals correctly with the end of the series. One possible treatment is not to ask to repeat the process when the last cell in the series is dealt with. Hint: For this subroutine it might be useful to think of the last cell in the series as the cell that fulfills the criterion Cell.Item(2,1).Formula = ”” (see section 39.2). 3. Write a subroutine that multiplies all cells in the current region by 2. 4. Rewrite the subroutine in exercise 3 so that its action is dependent on the cell ’ s contents. • If the cell contents is a formula, it will be replaced by the same formula multiplied by 2. • If the cell contents is a number, it will be replaced by a number equal to the old number multiplied by 2. • On all other cells in the current region, nothing will be done. Note: To make life easier, you may assume, for the purposes of this exercise, that a formula is anything beginning with “ = ” and a number is anything beginning with the characters “0” to “9.” 5. Rewrite the subroutine in exercise 4 so that it uses another method (the correct one) to detect the existence of a formula in a cell. Look at the different properties of the Range object in the Help file. 6. The annotations (using Getformula ) for worksheet formulas in this book were done with a subroutine. For example, running the subroutine on this worksheet 1070 Chapter 39 produces the following: Write a subroutine to perform the annotation. If the cell immediately to the right of the active cell is not empty, the subroutine should overwrite it with Getformula only after receiving confirmation from the user. 7. The Selection object represents the current selection in the worksheet. Selection is usually, and for our purposes always, a Range object. Rewrite the subroutine in exercise 6 so that it works on a selected range. Note the following: If the selected range is a single cell, activate the subroutine in exercise 6. If the selected range is a column, activate a subroutine repeatedly for all cells in the column. If the selected range is more than one column, the subroutine should abort with an appro-priate message. 8. Array functions are functions that return more than one value. For example, the Transpose worksheet function returns its argument turned by 90 degrees, as the following worksheet demonstrates: 1 2 34 5ABCDE F 1234 1 < - - { = T R A N S P O S E ( A 2 : D 2 ) } 2 <-- {=TRANSPOSE(A2:D2)} 3 <-- {=TRANSPOSE(A2:D2)}4 <-- {=TRANSPOSE(A2:D2)}TRANSPOSE IN ACTION The curly brackets were not typed in but were added by Excel to indicate an array formula. The following subroutine created the preceding worksheet: 1071 Objects and Add-Ins Sub TransposeMe() Range(“E3:E6”).FormulaArray = “ = Transpose(A3:D3)” End Sub The next subroutine is a more complicated version that could deal with any size or place in the row range: Sub TransposeMeToo() C = Selection.Columns.Count R = Selection.Rows.Count If C = 1 Then ‘Its a Column MsgBox “I don ’ t do Columns” ElseIf R = 1 Then ‘Its a Row Selection.Cells(1, C + 1).Range(“A1:A” & C). _ FormulaArray = “ = Transpose(“ _ & Selection.AddressLocal(False, False) & “)” Else ‘What is it? MsgBox “What is it?” End If End Sub Rewrite TransposeMeToo so it could deal with column ranges as well as row ranges. 9. Rewrite TransposeMeToo of exercise 8 so it could deal with all ranges.
